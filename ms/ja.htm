The Known World as it's never been known before! This fourth yearly
edition is different from the previous Poor Wizard's Almanacs. This
updated volume, assembled by new publisher Joshuan Gallidox, includes
more information useful to travelers, more maps of well-known (and some
not so well-known) places, "Spotlight On" segments focusing on
fascinating locations, plus special "You Are There" reports from
Joshuan's correspondents. "The Year in Review," covering the year AC
1013, and a special section of "Predictions and Prognostications" round
out the most entertaining and practical Almanac yet produced.<BR><BR>
Don't miss this chance to get the inside information (along with
extensive editorial commentary) on the Known World!<BR><BR>It only
comes out once a year...grab it before it disappears!
