A world in one volume - right in your hands! This, the third in the
yearly series of almanacs on the MYSTARA campaign setting, offers you
not only the most comprehensive look at the world of Mystara and its
complex nations and peoples, but for the first time gives you the AD&D
game statistics you need to bring the people and places to life!<BR><BR>
All the major world events for the year AC1012 are featured in detail,
picking up right where the <a href="../dd/dd-pwa2.htm">previous
almanac</a> ended. Read of riots and famine in Thyatis, armies of dead
men on the march, the shadow elves' attacks, the sighting of the
greatest sea monster of all, and the now-annual Day of Dread!<BR><BR><i>
A living world in one volume - don't miss a moment of it!<i>
