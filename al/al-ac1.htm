<b>In the Verge, you can go for dozens of light-years in any direction
without seeing a single sign of life. You can land on hundreds of
planets that are nothing more than frozen, airless rocks. And you can
live to tell about it. But what fun would that be?</b><BR><BR>Heroes
in the STAR*DRIVE setting want excitement, danger, and the thrill of
meeting strange and terrible lifeforms. <i>Creature of the Verge</i>,
the first ALIEN COMPENDIUM book for the ALTERNITY game, gives them
what they want... and may leave them wishing they had never left home.<BR><BR>
Inside this 128-page, full-color book are more than 60 detailed
descriptions and illustrations of aliens that live in and around the
planets of the Verge. The text traces the voyage of the Concord Survey
Vessel <i>Kepler</i> as it visits 14 different star systems around the
Verge. In these pages you'll meet:<BR><BR><UL><LI>The poisonous
blackworm of the planet Bhruusil, which uses vibrations to track its
prey.</ul><ul><li>The elegant and mysterious deepfallen, native to the
world-spanning oceans of Bluefall.</ul><ul><li>The beautiful but terrible
crystallis, one of the few creatures that can survive on the inferno
world of Polyphemus.</ul><ul><li>The "external" species - mysterious aliens
who exist outside known galactic society - including the violent n'sss,
the helpful blix, and the incomprehensible gardhyi.</UL>Some of these
aliens are viscious killers. Some of them are just the opposite. The
excitement and danger comes from figuring out which is which - before
the aliens figure out the truth about <i>you</i>.
