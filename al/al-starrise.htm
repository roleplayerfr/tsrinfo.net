<b>In the far future, representatives of the Galactic Concord make the
first trip to the Verge in almost a century. It starts with a call for
help, and now a rescue mission speeds through drivespace toward a distant
colony at Hammer's Star. The mighty fortress ship <i>Monitor</i> and
its support fleet rush across hundreds of light-years, desperate to
answer the distress call and unravel the riddle of the outpost on the
farthest edge of the Verge....</b><BR><BR>Now one group of heroes enters
the star system, seeking to learn the fate of the colony. As the
vanguard of the powerful star fleet, the heroes command the fast, heavily
armed star cutter <i>Shrike</i>. What they find waiting for them will
forever change the human concept of the universe and humanity's place
in the grand scheme of things.<BR><BR><i>Red Starrise</i> is an ALTERNITY
adventure that serves as a prelude to the STAR*DRIVE campaign setting.
This spine-tingling, far-future space opera is designed for level 1
heroes and is a great introduction to the ALTERNITY game.
