<b>For the past decade, klicks have struck at the humans of the
Hammer's Star system and then vanished into the depths of space. All
we've been able to do is react to their attacks. Striking back hasn't
been an option - but that's about to change.<BR><BR>A few weeks ago, a
Concord cutter found a gutted ship drifting in space, her crew dead.
The officer commanding the cutter ordered his crew to recover the
computer core. They found that it contained the location of what could
only be a klick base. The Concord has seized this oppurtunity to take
the war to the enemy.</b><BR><BR><i>Klick Clack</i> sends heroes into
the very jaws of the lion. It is modular in design, allowing Gamemasters
to reuse the base in future adventures. Included in the product is a
map of the base itself, and - for the first time - schematics of a
klick attack ship!<BR><BR>Designed for the STAR*DRIVE setting, <i>Klick
Clack</i> is also usable with any other campaign based on the ALTERNITY
game rules.
