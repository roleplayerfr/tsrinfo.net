<b>The StarMech Collective was in danger of being overwhelmed during the
Second Galactic War by the enormous Thuldan Empire. To save the lives
of its people, the Collective used its talent in robotics and automation
to create the Warhulks - massic spacegoing vessels bristling with
destructive capability and guided by the most sophisticated artificial
intelligence units ever to be installed in a starship.</b><BR><BR>When
the Treaty of Concord brought an end to the war in 2472, StarMech
recalled and deactivated its Warhulks... except for one. Lying
disabled and unnoticed in an insignificant star system, the Warhulk
designated <i>Ares 22</i> was stranded. Both its stardrive and its AI
unit had been damaged - the ship could not return home, and as a result
it never discovered that the war had ended.<BR><BR>Finally, more than
a quarter-century later, <i>Ares 22</i> has found the necessary
resources to repair its stardrive. The Last Warhulk is once again
operational - and on the prowl for enemies to annihilate.<BR><BR>This
64-page adventure for the STAR*DRIVE campaign setting pits the heroes
against a truly inhuman foe - a defective AI that believes itself to
be in perfect working order and has a vast array of killing devices at
its disposal. The heroes must disable the ship, or somehow dissuade it
from carrying out its deadly mission and wiping out millions of
innocent people.
