<center><b>INFINITY AWAITS YOU</center><BR><i>Tangents</i> is an
adventure!</b><BR><BR>Lucid Technologies has a problem. Its secret
research into dimensional travel has been sabotaged by fanatics, and
the multimillion-dollar facility is now only a bombed-out crater. But
where are the terrorists? They've been blown into alternate dimensions,
victims of the very tecnhology they sought to destroy.<BR>The heroes
must track the interdimensional castaways through superspace, traveling
through parallel worlds that run the gamut from primitive savagery to
nuclear desolation. If the heroes fail in their quest to end the
terrorists' rampage through alternate dimensions, there's no predicting
the consequences! Suitable for three to six heroes of any levels.<BR><BR><b><i>
Tangents</i> is a sourcebook!</b><BR><BR>Parallel universes are not just
science fiction - physics and mathematics predict worlds that resemble
and perhaps even duplicate out own. Infinite parallel universes
coexist with ours, each with qualities both familiar and foreign, and
alternative versions of history play out in endless variety "alongside"
out own world. This sourcebook provides a framework for interdimensional
adventuring in these parallel worlds, including information on how to
create and travel through one parallel universe after another. The
book also contains examples of unique sites, phenomena, and superspace
travelers for use in any ALTERNITY campaign.
