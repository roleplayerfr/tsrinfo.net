<b>In the future, human space has just emerged from a century-long galactic war.
The dark times are over. Now the rebuilding begins. It starts at the Kendai
communications relay, where the newly formed Galactic Concord hopes to
reestablish contact with a frontier region that was cut off at the height of the
conflict. A region known to those of Old Space as the Verge....</b><BR><BR>
Now a group of heavily armed terrorists has grabbed Kendai and plans to use the
relay to destroy the entire Concord communications network. Your group of heroes
is all that stands between terrorists, the spread of a deadly computer supervirus,
and the collapse of the fragile galactic peace concords.<BR><BR><i>Black Starfall</i>
is an ALTERNITY adventure that serves as a prelude to the STAR*DRIVE campaign
setting. This pulse-pounding, far-future technothriller is designed for level
1 heroes and makes a great introduction to the ALTERNITY game.
