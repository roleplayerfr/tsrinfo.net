The STAR*DRIVE Campaign Setting sweeps ALTERNITY game adventurers into
one possible future: a bright galaxy shining with humanity's accomplishments
but cursed with all of its flaws. The galaxy's attention centers around
the Verge, a region a mere one hundred light-years across that is home
to thousand of stars awaiting exploration by heroes. The <i>Star
Compendium</i> brings to life more than a dozen of those star systems.<BR><BR>

colonies (Vieron and Tychus), fledgling outposts (Talbott), and virgin
territory (Eldala).</ul><ul><li>Adventure hooks and oppurtunities to
entertain, challenge. and reward the brave and the clever.</ul>
