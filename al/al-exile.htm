It's the dawn of the 26th century. Human beings have left Earth's
cradle and established a civilization spanning hundreds of star systems.
New adventures - and new dangers - are everywhere, just waiting to be
discovered.<BR><BR>At the edge of human space, a group of human starfarers
discovers a centuries-old derelict adrift in unexplored space. Can they
survive the deadly threat posed by the derelict's ancient machinery and
unravel the mystery of the ship? Or will they join the ranks of countless
other explorers who have never been heard from again? Your actions,
your choices, and a little bit of luck will decide!<BR><BR>In this
booklet, you'll find everything you need to explore this wonderful and
terrifying future in a self-contained roleplaying game. The rules, a
shorthand version of the ALTERNITY science fiction roleplaying game,
take up a few pages at the beginning of the book. Gather a few friends,
get some polyhedral dice (available at most game, hobby, or bookstores),
and choose from one of four heroes who make up the crew of the <i>Momotaro</i>.<BR><BR>
