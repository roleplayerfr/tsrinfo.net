<b>One Grid Net journalist, known to a legion of Grid users as "Avatar,"
has dug through the rumors and conspiracies to get at the truth of the
many perils facing the Verge. Now you can examine the reports and
Grid-blurbs and decide for yourself if these threats are real - or just
more disinformation spread by the Concord, the Vergers, or the Old Space
news agencies hungry to make headlines in the Stellar Ring.</b><BR><BR><i>
Threats from Beyond</i> a collection of aventure hooks, new reports,
interviews, and other data uncovering a massive galactic conspiracy, is
designed for use with the STAR*DRIVE setting and other ALTERNITY game
science fiction campaigns. Inside this 96-page book you'll find:<BR><BR><UL><LI>
Updates on the movers, shakers, and key locations of the Verge.</ul><ul><li>
Evidence of a terrible threat from beyond the boundaries of known space -
a threat Avatar calls the Externals!</ul><ul><li>The most up-to-date events
shaping the Verge - from continuing confrontations between Arrivers and
Vergers; to the politics unfolding aboard the <i>Lighthouse</i> space
station; to reports conerning a variety of independent factions, including
pirates, cykoteks, mutants, mindwalkers, and criminal organizations;
to details about new alien species; and more!</ul><ul><li>Plenty of adventure
hooks to help incorporate these reports into any STAR*DRIVE campaign.</ul>
The news from the Verge isn't all good, but what news ever is? Jack
into the Grid, download Avatar's reports, and decide for yourself if
the External threat is real or the deluded imaginings of a burned-out
gridpilot. Just don't linger - you never know who might be watching.
