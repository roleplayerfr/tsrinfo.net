<center>EVERY BERK IN SIGIL STRUGGLES TO<BR>KEEP HIS SAVAGE SIDE AT BAY.<BR>
BUT NOW THE BARS OF THE CAGE ARE BREAKING DOWN....</center><BR><i>Don't
go to sleep, cutter - that's where the shadows slink, gnawing at the
frail cord of sanity. The dream-touched sods of Sigil are snapping one
by one, turning on each other like wildcats in the streets. And as
people become animals, animals become monsters, rending friend and foe
alike with fang and claw. The lawful factions have enough trouble
dealing with a rash of breakouts from the Prison. But when the shackles
of society fall away, it's all a body can do to keep the beast within
from bursting free - and running wild.<BR><BR>Something Wild</i> is a
PLANESCAPE adventure for four to six characters of 4th to 7th levels.
When Sigil falls prey to disturbing nightmares and outbreaks of violent
fury, the heroes must follow bloody trails to the treacherous peaks of
Carceri and the savage jungles of the Beastlands. An ancient terror
threatens the planes anew, and only the player characters can stop it
from feasting on the flesh of the multiverse.<BR><BR>The <a href="ps-box.htm">
PLANESCAPE <i>Campaign Setting</i></a> boxed set is required to run
this adventure. The <a href="ps-conflict.htm"><i>Planes
of Conflict Campaign Expansion</i></a> boxed set, the <a href="ps-mc1.htm">
PLANESCAPE MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM <i>Appendix</i></a>, and <a href="ps-cage.htm"><i>
In the Cage: A Guide to Sigil</i></a> are recommended as well.
