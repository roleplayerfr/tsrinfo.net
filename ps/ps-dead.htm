Silently, ponderously, they float through the Astral Plane, mammoth
isles of rock adrift in an endless sea of silver. Once they were gods.
Now they're little more than debris, petrified husks of fading belief
and forgotten prayer. Yet for many, their memories linger, their
dreams live on - and for some, those dreams are terrifying nightmares
of vengeance, and conquest, and death.<BR><BR>Dead Gods</i> is a
176-page adventure book featuring two scenarios that can be played
separately or linked together. In the first, the heroes are drawn into
an epic quest to uncover the secrets behind the return of an infamous
AD&D villain long though dead. In the second, the city of Sigil
threatens to explode in a faction war for control of an old church and
a mysterious force lurking within it. <i>Dead Gods</i> also features a
MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM entry for a brand-new fiend, full-color illustrations
to bring scenes alive for players, and a poster sheet of maps for the
Dungeon Master.<BR><BR><i>Dead Gods</i> builds on story elements first
explored in the PLANESCAPE adventure anthology <a href="ps-modron.htm"><i>
The Great Modron March</i></a>, though that product is not required to
use this one.
