<center>"EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT FIENDS<br>(BUT WERE
AFRAID TO ASK).</center><BR><i>I've seen it happen too many times. A berk
finds out how much damage it takes to kill a fiend and figures that's
all he needs. Then he heads off to the Lower Planes - and is never
heard from again. When will these leatherheads learn? The fiends
aren't just lists of numbers. They're creatures that think, eat, dream,
breed, struggle, and evolve - in short, creatures that </i>live<i>.
They're part of a larger society of political treachery and desperate
survival, a culture of disturbing aesthetics and violent beliefs. And
only a blood who studies it all has a hope of ducking the fiends,
defeating them - or just understanding them.<BR><BR> </i>This 96-page
PLANESCAPE accessory, written for players and Dungeon Masters of all
levels, is the ultimate guide to the fiends of the Lower Planes - the
malevolent monsters that wage the Blood War, terrorize mortals, and
befoul the multiverse. But whereas other guides focus on statistics
and combat, <i>Faces of Evil</i> delves into the physiology of the
fiends, exploring the dark forces that shape every detail of their
lives. How are they born? What do they eat? How do they deal with
others? And just what makes them so - well <i>fiendish?<BR><BR>Faces
of Evil</i> is a must for any AD&D campaign that features these vile
creatures of death and destruction.</font>
