<center>THE POWERS MOVE IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.<br>AT LEAST, THEY DID - UNTIL
NOW.</center><BR>No ordinary tome can hold the powers of the planes,
berk. That's why <i>On Hallowed Ground</i> is two books in one. In the
first chapters, learn what divine compacts keep the gods from tearing
the multiverse apart. Get the dark on turning player characters into
proxies. Find out what happens when a spellslinger brings a petitioner
back to life. And tumble to the awesome prestige - and awesome <i>danger</i> -
of walking the Great Ring as a priest.<BR><BR>The second part of <i>On
Hallowed Ground</i> delivers the chant on hundreds of AD&D game powers,
from Aasterrinian to Zivilyn - and just about every high-up in between.
More than a summary of old material, it updates the AD&D game's gods
for the PLANESCAPE campaign setting, featuring their trusted proxies,
their brash rivalries, and their hard-won roles in the cosmos.<BR><BR>
Written for Dungeon Masters and players, this 192-page, full-color
book includes:<BR><BR>20 separate pantheons detailing the powers
worshipped by humans, demihumans, and monsters (including the deities
of the AD&D game worlds). Zues, Sung Chiang, Gruumsh, Takhisis -
they're all here, based on chant from <a href="../dd1/ll.htm"><i>
Legends & Lore</i></a>, the <a href="../dd1/dd.htm">DEITIES &
DEMIGODS</a> book, <a href="../dd1/dmgr4.htm"><i>Monster
Mythology</i></a>, and AD&D game world sources.<BR>New ideas and rules
for priest characters on the planes.<BR>Tips on creating, visiting, and
surviving divine realms.<BR>A look at powers favored by factions and
planewalkers.<BR>Comprehensive appendices listing gods by pantheon and
portfolio.<BR>Full-color maps of realms glorious and infernal.
