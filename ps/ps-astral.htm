<center>"SO WHY DO THEY CALL IT THE SILVER VOID?<BR>MUST MEAN THERE'S
NOTHIN' THERE...RIGHT?</center>-SOME CLUELESS SOD<BR><BR>Most berks
think the Astral Plane's an empty place, serving as nothing but a cosmic
highway connecting all the other places in the multiverse. Canny
planewalkers know differently, though. Here are just a few of the
"secrets" of the Silver Void that this book explains:<BR><BR>It is the
backdrop of the multiverse, where phenomena such as space and time are
so vastly different from "normal" that only a true blood knows his way
around.<BR><BR>When he's on the Astral Plane, a basher moves, fights,
and acts solely with his mind.<BR><BR>It is the closest thing the
multiverse has to a "plane of magic," where sorcery and spells are not
only more powerful, but are palpable, tangible objects.<BR><BR>The
primary inhabitants are the infamous githyanki, an ancient race of
wizards and warriors who know the dark of many secrets forbidden to
others.<BR><BR>The Astral Plane is literally the dead-book of the gods.<BR><BR>
