<i>You've never seen a skull like this one, cutter - it's made of a
silvery metal, with rainbow hues cascading over its shiny surface.
Local bashers call it a mimir. Toss it into the air, and ask it
questions: What is Ecstasy? Do fiends patrol the Outlands? The
floating skull slicks softly, scouring its enchanted vaults for the
answers. Then its bone-box opens, drivens by ancient pistons, and it
begins to speak....</i><BR><BR>A PLANESCAPE accessory for player
characters of all levels, the <i>Player's Primer</i> provides a look at
the Outlands, which surround the great city of Sigil - the gateway to
all the Outer Planes. In this box, a cutter'll find:<BR><BR>An audio
compact disc that represents the mimir, a new magical item offering a
strange and thrilling tour of the Outlands. More than 40 CD tracks
allow players to hear what their characters would hear when consulting
this handy (and some say dangerous) oracle.<BR><BR>A 32-page guide to
the most important sites and features of the Outlands.<BR><BR>A
full-color poster map of the Outlands with never-before-seen maps of
gate-towns.<BR><BR><center>THE LAND'S FULL OF WONDER <i>AND</i> DANGER,
BERK. GET THE<BR>CHANT FROM THE <i>PLAYER'S PRIMER</i> - AND STAY
ALIVE!
