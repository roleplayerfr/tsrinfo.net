<center>CLUELESS IS AS GOOD AS DEAD.</center><BR><i>Don't matter if you're
a blood's blood or a leatherhead with a lot to learn - this book's for
you. The planes are full of critters that'd just as soon kill a berk
as look at him, and plenty more that like to rattle their bone-boxes
for nothing more than the sheer pleasure of it. What a cutter needs is
a book like this one - something that tells the real dark of what's
waiting out there, just on the other side of that portal.</i><BR><BR>
This MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM appendix contains nearly 100 new monsters from
the Outlands and various Outer Planes, and a few updated creatures that
haven't seen print for quite some time. The aasimar, a new player
character race, awaits your discovery - along with eladrins, hollyphants,
rilmani, new tanar'ri, and more!
