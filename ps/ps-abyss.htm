<i>Looking for a little extra jink and maybe some excitement? It seems
the Doomguard lost track of their coveted </i>ship of chaos.<i> It's
flying about the Abyss, driving the local tanar'ri even more barmy than
they already are. Several factions want to get their hands on the
Doomguard's stake, so there's bound to be a few job offers for bloods
looking for a little action.<BR>Every sod's got a tale to tell about
the Abyss - it's the sinkhole of the multiverse, after all, peopled
with every kind of scum a body can imagine and a few he can't. Never
been there? Well, there's no time like the present.<BR><BR>In the
Abyss</i> is a PLANESCAPE adventure for a party of four to six characters
who are of levels 8 to 10. A simple errand to salvage the lost ship of
chaos allows the player characters their first opportunity to explore
the most notorious plane of them all. Of course, complications are as
inevitable as the tanar'ri!<BR>The <a href="ps-box.htm"><i>
Planescape Campaign Setting</i></a> and <a href="ps-chaos.htm"><i>
Planes of Chaos</i></a> boxed sets, as well as the <a href="ps-mc1.htm">
PLANESCAPE MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM APPENDIX</a> are required to run this
adventure.
