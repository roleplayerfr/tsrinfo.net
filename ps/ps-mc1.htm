<center>LISTEN UP, CUTTER...</center><BR><i>There's lots of bashers that
can plant you pretty fast, out here in the planes. And that's the only
"pretty" thing about most of 'em. A blood's got to know what's what, or
the results won't rise. A lot of creatures out here're just plain bad,
and even the good ones can burn you if you rattle your bonebox wrong.
What a cutter needs is a guide to what's out there, and if it's twice
as big as the previous guide and illustrated in color, that's just a
bonus. Sure, there's been other guides to planar creatures, but most're
hard to find, don't scan the turf, or just don't have the straight
chant....</i><BR><BR>This MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM appendix includes a
broad spectrum of monsters from the Inner, Outer, Astral, and Ethereal
Planes - all geared to provide hours of adventure in the PLANESCAPE
campaign setting. Replacing the original <a href="../dd1/mc8.htm"><i>
Outer Planes Appendix</i></a>, this new and enlarged compendium includes
full-color illustrations, reintroducing many of the best mulitplanar
monsters from a wide variety of out-of-print sources.
