<center>FOUR DOORS OF MYSTERY APPEAR IN THE<BR>CAGE. THEY LEAD TO FOUR
ADVENTURES,<BR>IF A BASHER HAS THE DARK OF THEM.</center><BR><i>"These aren't
doors in the traditional sense, cutter, but they're portals just the
same. They appear for a short time every 500 years, popping up in
different parts of Sigil. Each hides a mystery that's waiting to be
solved, and together they just might hold the key to a secret of the
multiverse. All a body's got to do is tumble to the right keys, open
the doors, and face down the Unknown."<BR><BR>-Estavan, merchant lord<BR><BR>
Doors to the Unknown</i> is a collection of four PLANESCAPE adventures
that can be played separately or as a mini-campaign. When four doors
appear in the Cage, the barmies crawl out of the shadows, and the
heroes get drawn into events that could have consequences for the
entire multiverse. Each door leads to a different plane and a different
deadly challenge for the player characters. Together they offer a way
to stop an ancient menace before it strikes again.<BR><BR>The <a href="ps-box.htm">
PLANESCAPE <i>Campaign Setting</i></a> boxed set is required to run
these adventures. The <a href="ps-mc1.htm">PLANESCAPE
MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM <i>Appendix (I</a> and <a href="ps-mc2.htm">
II</a>)</i> and <a href="ps-uncaged.htm"><i>Uncaged: Faces
of Sigil</i></a> are recommended to enhance play.
