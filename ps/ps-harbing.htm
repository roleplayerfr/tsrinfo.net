<center>A SUCCUBUS WITH AN UNQUENCHABLE LUST FOR POWER IS TURNING THE
CAGE INTO A RIPPING MADHOUSE, AND THE LADY OF PAIN AIN'T PLEASED....<BR><BR>
</center><i>Somthing's foul in Sigil, berk. A mad slasher prowls the
streets, leaving a trail of bloody clues in his wake. Leatherheads
boldly court the Lady of Pain, longing for the sharp touch of her
shadow. Even the silent dabus're acting barmy, a sure sign that the
Lady </i>herself<i> is uneasy. Are these strange events tied to a
madhouse full of spell-touched sods ready to slip the bonds of
mortality? A curious body'd better step carefully. After all, the
dead-book's full of fools who wished for power - or got in the way of
another berk's wish.<BR><BR>Harbinger House</i> is a PLANESCAPE adventure
for four to six characters of 4th to 7th levels. From Sigil to the
Outlands and back again, the heroes must piece together a puzzle that
could shake the Cage to its foundations. A dark secret of the
multiverse waits to be discovered in the lunatic asylum called
Harbinger House, and only the player characters can shape its power -
for good or ill.<BR><BR>The <a href="ps-box.htm">PLANESCAPE <i>
Campaign Setting</i></a> boxed set is required to run this adventure.
