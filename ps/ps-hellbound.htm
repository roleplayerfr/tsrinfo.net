<center><b>WAR IS HELL - LITERALLY.</b><BR><BR><i>Since before mortals
drew breath, the cunning baatezu and the fiery tanar'ri have struggled
furiously to batter each other out of existence. The prize in their
devastating war of annihilation: the Lower Planes. 'Course, when two
unstoppable armies of evil collide, the tremors might leave the entire
multiverse a smoking ruin. And woe be to any berk who stands against
them - or simply gets in their way.</i></center><BR>Created for both
players and Dungeon Masters, <i>Hellbound: The Blood War</i> is a
comprehensive resource on the infernal clash that has torn the planes
apart for millennia. Though the war has spilled into many other PLANESCAPE
products, the full story of the roaring conflict has never been detailed -
until now. <i>Hellbound</i> features:<BR><BR><i>The Dark of the War,</i>
an 80-page guide for the Dungeon Master that reveals the secrets of the
struggle - its history, strategies, magic, and battlefields.<BR><BR><i>
The Chant of the War,</i> a 32-page book for DMs and players, detailing
the facts that player characters would know about the conflict.<BR><BR><i>
War Games,</i> a 96-page book of three complete Blood War adventures,
including an epic scenario in which the PCs can weaken the fiends
permanently and <i>forever</i> change the course of the war - not to
mention create a brand-new monster in the process.<BR><BR><i>Visions of
War,</i> a 24-page, full-color booklet of illustrations and maps (scenes
and sites in the adventures) to bring the war's horrors alive for
players.<BR><BR><i>The Bargain,</i> a 16-page, full-colo comic book of
wartime love and betrayal, painted by DiTerlizzi and Robh Ruppel.<BR><BR><center>
