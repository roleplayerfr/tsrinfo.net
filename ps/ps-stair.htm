<center>THE INFINITE STAIRCASE IS A PLANEWALKER'S DREAM.<BR>BUT A DREAM
CAN TURN INTO A NIGHTMARE....</center><BR><i>Stretching to every plane
imaginable, the Infinite Staircase is one of the best-kept secrets of
planar travel in the multiverse. Watched over by the mysterious lillendi,
the Staircase stretches in all directions, beding back upon itself to
form the ultimate three-dimensional maze - and every landing where the
Staircase stops, a doorway to a new planar location awaits the traveler.</i><BR>
The chaotic morass of energy and matter filling Limbo holds a dark
secret - the same secret found in the depths of Baator, in an
underground formian hive-city on Arcadia, and in a battle-torn githyanki
fortress on the Astral Plane. Using the Infinite Staircase, a group
of planewalkers must travel to these far-flung locations, and elsewhere,
to learn of a new threat to the planes - and stop it. Even exploring
the Staircase iitself can be dangerous, particularly when it's
ravaged by a barmy fiend and an even crazier sorceress.<BR><BR><i>Tales
From the Infinite Staircase</i> features eight serparate but linked
adventures presented in a new format. The adventures can be played in
any order, yet each scenario impacts upon and changes those played
after it. Further, the PCs can return to the individual scenario
locations and find that conditions have changed so that more adventuring
is possible. Each of the eight adventures can also be played separately.<BR><BR>
<i>Tales From the Infinite Staircase</i> can be linked with the epic
adventure from the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting, <a href="../fr/duty.htm"><i>
For Duty & Deity</i></a>, wherein the heroes must traverse the Infinite
Staircase to reach the foreboding realm of Graz'zt, a wicked lord of
the Abyss.
