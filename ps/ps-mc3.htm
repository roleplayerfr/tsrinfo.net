<center>HOW DOES A BERK FIGHT SOMETHING<BR>HE CAN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND?</center><BR><i>
Things are different on the Inner Planes. Oh, some bashers might say
they're </i>deadlier<i>, or </i>harsher<i>, or just plain </i>weirder<i>,
but this truth is, they're merely different. And on planes full of
nothing but searing magmas, swampy ooze, glittering mineral, utter
desolation, or life incarnate, is it any wonder that a body'd find
creatures as alien as any the multiverse has ever seen? Things that
eat color, leaving a victim fully transparent. Beasts that spread life
like a virus, animating all things around them. Spirits that form
bodies by forcing hundreds of smaller animals to act as one. It's
enough to make a sod long for a pit fiend.</i><BR><BR>Liven up any
PLANESCAPE or AD&D campaign with the MOSNTROUS COMPENDIUM <i>Appendix
III</i>, which features 128 pages of monsters that lurk on the Inner
Planes, the Astral Plane, and the Ethereal Plane - some of the
strangest and most inhospitable environments in the multiverse. Most
of the critters are brand new, though a few old favorites have been
updated. This book also provides a detailed look at the ecology of the
planes in question, not to mention an appendix of inner-planar creatures
that're more like animals than monsters. And, of course, all-new
illustrations vividly bring each of these exotic beings to life.
