<center>IN THE OUTER PLANES, A HOLY SWORD<BR>CAN BE A FIEND'S BEST
FRIEND,<BR>ESPECIALLY WHEN THE OWNER WANTS IT BACK....</center><BR><i>
Sneaking into the second layer of foul Baator ain't easy, but with a
little help from the right high-up men, it can be done. 'Course,
exactly who the right high-up men </i>are<i> can give a basher pause,
so it's often best not to ask. But there's a sword to be found, and
bloods needed to find it. Truth is, those who don't end up lost are
sure to find out that no good deed goes unpunished!<BR><BR>Fires of
Dis</i> is a PLANESCAPE adventure for four to six characters of 5th to
9th levels. From Sigil, the City of Doors, the heroes plunge head-first
into a dangerous journey across the Outer Planes. Their quest for a
stolen sword leads them to the hostile gate-town of Ribcage, the
treacherous plane of Baator, and the disciplined burg of Fortitude - a
gate-town teetering between two planes, just waiting for something to
tip the scales. Your player characters need wits as keen as their
steed to brave the fires of Dis - and survive!
