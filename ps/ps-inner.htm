<center>THE PRIME MATERIAL PLANE IS FORMED OF SOLID<BR>MATTER. THE
OUTER PLANES ARE FORMED OF<BR>BELIEF. THE INNER PLANES...ARE.</center><BR><i>
Beyond the Prime's infinite crytal spheres, beyond the endless realms
of the Outer Planes, lies the absolute reality of the Inner Planes. The
cornerstone planes of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water are the most well-known
Inner Planes, but they're only the beginning. From the deadly purity
of the Positive and Negative Energy Planes to the unbearable filth of
the plane of Ooze to the eternal storm of the plane of Lightning, the
Elemental Planes are the substance of existence itself. These eighteen
planes form the foundation of the entire multiverse; they are the
cauldron from which all energy and matter are brewed.<BR><BR></i>The
Inner Planes<i> details the Elemental, Paraelemental, Quasielemental,
and Energy Planes. Surviving these planes can be a challenge, but
within these pages DMs and players learn how characters can adventure
among the unearthly locales and strange denizens.<BR><BR>This planar
sourcebook includes:<BR><BR></i>Detailed descriptions of the environments
and regions of each of the eighteen Inner Planes.<BR>Rules for movement,
and combat, and survival within these strange and unique environments.<BR>
Information about the inhabitants and ecology of each plane, including
elementals, genies, mephits, and even stranger beasts.<BR>Interesting
and important locales within the Inner Planes, including such diverse
places as the City of Brass in the plane of Fire, the Mountain of
Ultimate Winter in the plane of Ice, the Refuge of Color in the plane
of Radiance, and the mysterious, aeons-old abandoned towers of the
Quasielemental Planes.<BR><BR><center>GO TO THE EXTREMES!</center>
