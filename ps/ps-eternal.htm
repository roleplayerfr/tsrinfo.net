<i>Welcome to the Cage, friend. You'll want to watch your back in Sigil -
it seems every cutter here's got a way to peel a clueless basher, and
you're no exception. Besides, there's something happening down in the
Hive that's got the factions in an uproar, and word is you're the
cutter to look into it. Barmies and bubbers have been waking up in the
Dead Book, but they haven't been staying there. They've been returning
to Sigil with minds restored, telling tales of the Eternal Boundary.
But the air's turning foul here in the Cage, and there'll be blood
spilled soon if someone doesn't learn the dark of things, an quick!<BR><BR>
The Eternal Boundary</i> is a PLANESCAPE adventure for a party of four
to six characters of 1st to 5th levels. Players are introduced to the
city of Sigil - the Cage, as some call it. Inside this crossroads to
the planes, a sinister plot unfolds, leading the heroes into the most
dangerous and desperate part of town - the ramshackle slum known as
the Hive. Do your player characters have what it takes to confront the
Eternal Boundary - and pass beyond?
