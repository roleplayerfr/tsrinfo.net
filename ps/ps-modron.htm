<center>THE NEXT MARCH WASN'T DUE FOR ANOTHER 189 YEARS.<br>TRY TELLING
THAT TO THE MODRONS!</center><BR><i>On a regular schedule, the Great
Modron March spills out of Mechanus and the lawful automatons files
their way around the Great Ring. No one knows why they do it, but
everyone stays out of their way - because when the modrons march,
they'll walk right over a berk who doesn't know enough to move aside.<BR><BR>
But </i><u>this</u><i> March has started decades before it was supposed
to begin, and that's even more of a mystery. Caught unprepared, the
planes shudder under the modrons' collective footsteps - and even the
modrons themselves seem a little out of sorts.<BR><BR>The Great Modron
March</i> anthology features 11 adventures for characters ranging from
1st to 10th level as well as new information about the modrons of
Mechanus. Each adventure can be played separely or linked together to
form an extended campaign. The modron procession touches every Outer
Plane in turn - and it isn't always welcome. On their unswerving path,
the clockwork creatures will destroy celestial towns, be attacked by
evil knights intent on using modron parts in foul experiments, and
lead characters onto the deadly plains of the Abyss and into the famous
prime-material labyrinth of Undermountain. Without help, they'll be
lost in the swirling chaos of Limbo or even fail to complete the March
entirely. And along their route, every blood on the planes seeks the
answer to the most important question: Why have the Modrons abandoned
their normal, lawful schedule to march years before they're due?<BR><BR>
The Modron March is a once-in-a-lifetime event for any adventurer - and
the player characters can participate every step of the way!
