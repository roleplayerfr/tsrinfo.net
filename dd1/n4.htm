<center>Marooned on a barren isle...</center><BR><BR>The island of Viledel, the mighty Sea
King, was sacked by a pirate army 60 years ago. Its destruction was so
complete that even the location of the island was lost and forgotten.
Despite the rumors of immense treasures still hidden in the ruined
stronghold, no one ever found the Sea King's island again.<BR><BR>Until now.
Through a cruel twist of fate, a small band of unwilling adventurers is
washed ashore on a small, barren island, and discovers what remains of
Viledel's settlement. But they aren't alone; marauding orcs and goblins
have found the island, too, and are frantically searching for the lost
hoard. In this desperate treasure hunt, the real payoff may be survival.<BR><BR><b>
Treasure Hunt</b> is different from other AD&D game adventures. The player
characters begin the game at 0 level, without choosing a class, and
must work their way up to 1st level. It is perfect for a group of
beginning players or experienced players looking for a new and different
challenge.
