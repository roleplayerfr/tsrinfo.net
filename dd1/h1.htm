The first <a href="bs.htm">BATTLESYSTEM</a> Supermodule from TSR, Inc!<BR>
The tiny village of Bloodstone Pass is menaced by an army of thousands
of brigands - orcs, goblins, giants, and human renegades led by a
powerful assassin. Outnumbered and helpless, the villagers must pay
tribute in gold, food...slaves.<BR>Two villagers have travelled far to
find aid for their people. They have turned to you, brave and powerful
adventurers, as their only hope. They cannot afford to pay more than a
few silver pieces a day, but their need is great.<BR>You are invited to
save the people of Bloodstone Pass. Can you organize a defense, train
and equip the peasants, recruit allies, gather intelligence...and win
the war?<BR>BLOODSTONE PASS is an exciting good-aligned, high-level
(15+) adventure that combines roleplaying with the thrill of mass
combat. A complete 3-D ADVENTURE FOLD-UP village makes the battle
come alive!
