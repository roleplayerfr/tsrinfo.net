<i>This module
was originally used for the Official DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
tournament at <b>Origins I</b>. The author wishes to express his thanks to Mr. Alan Lucien
who was kind enough to submit the ideas for this dungeon. This version
has been revised and updated to conform to ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS.
Included herein are background information for players, including the
<b>Legend of the Tomb</b> - as is true of all TSR DUNGEON MODULES, the
location of this area is upon the <b>Map of the World of Greyhawk</b> (WORLD OF
GREYHAWK by TSR) - DM notes, level map and matrix, player character
statistics for varying numbers of participants, and over two dozen
special illustrations to graphically enhance your players' enjoyment
of the adventure, as the drawings are keyed to various scenes and
encounters iin the Tomb.</i>
