Pommeville is a sleepy little town that seems like a
good place to stay for the night. That is, until the town's dead rise
from their graves and begin terrorizing the village! Ancient evil
threatens to overwhelm the good folk of Pommeville unless someone can
find a way to comfort the restless dead. A lone, player character cleric
will have to be clever, courageous, and more than a little lucky to
solve the mystery and save Pommeville from the mindless zombies that
threaten it!<BR><BR><i>Cleric's Challenge</i> is a special ONE-ON-ONE ADVANCED
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure designed for a DUNGEON MASTER and one
player - perfect for very small playing groups, or for the player who
wants his or her character to earn some extra experience.
