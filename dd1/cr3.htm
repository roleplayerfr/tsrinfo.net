<center><i><b>Now a whole treasure chest of magical hardware is literally
in the pocket!</b></i></center><BR>Wizards, priests, and other
characters who carry a small arsenal of magical items can now keep all
the operator's instructions within easy reach with these useful
reference cards.<BR><BR>The front of each card lists a magical item's
game statistics and special icons that quickly identify the item's
type and who can use it. On the back of the card, the item is
described in detail, eliminating the need to waste precious gaming time
combing through books to see how it works. When the character identifies
his or her latest find from a treasure hoard, the DM can simply hand
over the corresponding card, and the game goes on!<BR><BR>Over 400
magical items from the <a href="dmg2.htm">DUNGEON MASTER
Guide</a> and the <a href="tome.htm"><i>Tome of Magic</i></a>
are included, plus a few cards that be used to record specialty or
original items.<BR><BR>Also look for the <a href="cr1.htm">
