At last, gaming screens for players, too!<BR>The Wizard's Screen speeds
up game play by taking the most frequently used character-specific
information from the AD&D game <a href="phb2.htm"><i>
Player's Handbook</i></a> and <a href="phbr4-1.htm"><i>
Complete Wizard's Handbook</i></a> and making it instantly accessible.
Now the details players need on the spot to play any of the wizard
classes - including mages, specialist wizards, wild mages, or
elementalists - can be right at their
fingertips. The screen folds in a neat triangle that sits on the table
top in front of players for at-a-glance reference.<BR>Also enclosed are
eight additional pages of valuable reference material that can be slipped
into character folders. These pages feature an extensive <a href="phb2.htm"><i>
Player's Handbook</i></a> and <a href="tome.htm"><i>Tome of
Magic</i></a> spell and spell-statistics list,
and other handy tables and charts.
