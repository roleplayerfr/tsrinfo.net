goblin head a knock-knock-knocking in the upper corridor - those nosy
explorers have found the secret entrance to the goblin den! Herpulh

Welcome to <i>Reverse Dungeon</i> the adventure where everything is
backward! Instead of playing bold heroes who venture into dens of evil,
the players take the roles of the monsters, determined to stop
adventurers from invading their homes. Instead of always being the
good guys, the players get a chance to be the bad guys.<BR><BR><i>
Reverse Dungeon</i> contains three linked minicampaigns in which the
players represent:<BR><BR>Goblins whose warrens are under siege from a
band of heroes seeking fame and fortune;<BR><BR>Guardian abominations
whose vaults are attacked from several directions at once; and<BR><BR>
Ancient undead that must defend the silence of their tomb against
crusading clerics intent on detroying them.<BR><BR>Enter the <i>Reverse
Dungeon</i> - and find out how it feels to be on the receiving end of
a hero's blade.
