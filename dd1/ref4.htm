This is the second in a series of ground-breaking AD&D accessories.
Within these pages are nearly 70 fully developed adventures that can be
inserted into any campaign. They are ready-to-play challenges for all
levels of characters. DMs need not spend long hours creating diversions
for their players - we've done it for you.<BR>If you have <i><a href="ref3.htm">The Book of
Lairs</a></i>, you already know what you'll find herein. These mini-
adventures are arranged by terrain type (city, desert, hills, mountains,
forest, etc.), with monsters in alphabetical order for easy access. At
the back of the book is a combined monsters statistics table, showing
all the neccessary figures at a glance.<BR>These are familiar monsters
(like the gnome, brownie, and ettin) and not so familiar ones (like the
bakemono and tengu), from both original AD&D sources and the <a href="oa.htm">
Oriental Adventures</a> book. Some of these mini-adventures are mere
diversions; others can turn into minor campaigns! In any case, DMs and
players alike are sure to be pleased with <i>The Book of Lairs II</i>.
