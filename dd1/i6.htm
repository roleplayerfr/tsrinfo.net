Under raging stormclouds, a lone figure stands silhouetted
against the ancient walls of castle Ravenloft. Count Strahd von Zarovich
stares down a sheer cliff at the village below. A cold, bitter wind
spins dead leaves around him, billowing his cape in the darkness.<BR><BR>
Lightning splits the clouds overhead, casting stark white light across
him. Strahd turns to the sky, revealing the angular muscles of his face
and hands. He has a look of power - and of madness. His once-handsome
face is contorted by a tragedy darker than the night itself.<BR><BR>Rumbling
thunder pounds the castle spires. The wind's howling increases as
Strahd turns his gaze back to the village. Fas below, yet not beyond
his keen eyesight, a party of adventurers has just entered his domain.
Strahd's face forms a twisted smile as his dark plan unfolds. He knew
they were coming, and he knows why they came, all according to his plan.
He, the master of Ravenloft, will attend to them.<BR><BR>Another lightning
flash rips through the darkness, its thunder echoing through the
castle's towers. But Strahd is gone. Only the howling of the wind -
or perhaps a lone wolf - fills the midnight air. The master of Ravenloft
is having guests for dinner. And you are invited.</td></tr><tr><td><BR></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="silver">
