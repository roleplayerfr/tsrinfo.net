<i>Treasure Chest</i> contains 16 seperate adventures that
will lead player characters across oceans, through trackless forests,
and into desert wastes. Great perils and greater rewards can lurk
anywhere. An adventure might present itself while player characters
study a dusty puzzle box, find the lonely grave of a fellow hero, read
arcane lore, or even gather the loot from a successgul expedition. One
adventure leads to another.<BR><BR>Each adventure comes with two beautifully
rendered color illustrations, one for the players and one for the
DUNGEON MASTER, that provide the clues that get the action started.
Also provided are rumors and folklore associated with each adventure.
These adventures are adaptable for play in any AD&D game world, either
as brief encounters or the beginnings of epic quests. The DM can also
use any of the 32 full-color illustrations to create adventures of his
or her own.
