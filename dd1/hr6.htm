<center><i>"Future generations will marvel at us,<BR>as the present age
marvels at us now."<BR>-Pericles, the Athenian statesmen</i></center><BR>
Their names were Achilles, Odysseus, Jason, Heracles, and Alexander.
Their deeds pitted them against monsters, men, and the known world.
They were Greeks, and theirs was the age of heroes. <i>Age of Heroes</i>
transforms this epic time of myth and history into an exciting AD&D
setting, with details on spells, magical items, new character kits,
maps, pictures of ancient Greek life, and a starting adventure.<BR>The
challenge has gone out - let only the heroes heed the call.
