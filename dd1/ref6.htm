Rogues' Gallery</i>. Look within and you'll find all manner of non
player-character warriors, wizards, priests, and rogues with all their
class variations, fully developed and ready to drop into any AD&D
campaign. Each of the characters is detailed in the standard, convenient
<i>Monstrous Compendium</i> format - including an illustration - with a
biography including his or her favorite combat tactics, regular hang-
outsm likely cohorts, and much more.<BR><BR>NPCs have lives too; give them
more than just a number when they next meet and challenge your
adventuring party! Visit the <i>Rogues' Gallery</i> and hire some good
help.
