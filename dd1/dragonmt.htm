<i>The rubble-strewn passageway twists and turns, winding ever deeper
into the mountain, lower and lower into the bowels of the ancient,
forbidding halls of long-dead dwarves. The torchlight flickers,
threatening to succumb to the oppressive darkness. Creeping along one
striated granite wall, Arikus the warrior moves cautiously toward the
great cavern ahead, its sides and walls disappearing into the gloomy
distance. Cocking his head to one side to listen, he holds his hand up
for a moment, demanding unconditional quiet from from his companions.
Then , his arm relaxing in relief, he waves everyone forward and moves
into the open. Before him, scattered to the far walls of the enormous
cavern, are piles upon piles of glittering treasure - coins from
countless kingdoms, sparkling gems, exquisite jewelry, and items of
wondrous power - enough for twenty kings' ransoms. Arikus laughs
gleefully, thrusting both hands into the nearest cache of coins to let
them runs through his fingers. At that moment, a monstrous shadow looms
threateningly over him. Looking up, Arikus blanches and stumbles back
in horror before the terrible visage of a Great Red Wyrm. The
fearsome dragon opens its razor-filled maw and spews forth a gout of
white-hot flame, engulfing the hapless warrior....</i><BR><BR>The
