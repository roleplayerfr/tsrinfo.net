This package consists of two durable and folding cardstock screens for
the DM's reference use in playing <b>ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS:</b>
an 11" × 34" folder of the COMBAT AND SAVING THROW TABLES, and an 11" ×
17" folder of the PSIONIC COMBAT TABLES. These screens are useful for
shielding maps and other game materials from the players when place
upright, and also provide instant reference to the most commonly used
charts and tables during play. The player's side is colorfully
illustrated to help set the mood, as well as printed with tables for the
more standard character classes and the WEAPONS TABLE. These folders
have been laminated on both sides to protect them against common wear
and tear. This (and only this) screen contains all the official <b>AD&D</b>
statistics and tables.<BR><BR>
