Something evil is stalking the parish of Barlox.<BR><BR>Ten years ago, the village's
temple burned to the ground and the parish priest disappeared. The temple has
since been rebuilt, but life has not returned to normal. A current of fear and
discontent now ripples beneath the surface of this once sleepy wine-making
community. Old rivalries have turned bitter, and unwittingly unleashed a force
of ancient corruption.<BR><BR><i>Cleric's Challenge II</i> is a special ONE-ON-ONE
ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure designed for a Dungeon Master and one
player character cleric of 4th to 6th level. It is the eighth in a series of
independant adventures focusing on an individual character of a specific class.
