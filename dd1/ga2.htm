The city of Chala, nestled on the banks of the Leal
river, has prospered for generations. But now the city faces misfortune,
pestilence, and decay, because the icon which brought it prosperity has
been stolen. All the clues suggest that the sacred object was carried
into the heart of nearby Blackweed Swamp. But who, or what, would
commit such a crime? Whoever is responsible, the statue must be recovered,
at any cost.<BR><BR>Are there heroes who can face the horrors of the swamp
and reclaim the precious statue? Are they clever enough to unravel a
scheme far more sinister than simple theft? Or will they, like others
before them, be lured into the clutches of some terrible evil inhabiting
the gloomy marsh and disappear forever?
