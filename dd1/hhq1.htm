<b>D</b>ecades ago, Sturnheim was a thriving trade town on a major caravan
route. But then, disaster struck when a gold-laden caravan disappeared without
a trace. Financially ruined, the town slipped into decline, and now lies almost
forgotten on a route that is seldom traveled anymore.<BR><RB><i><b>F</b>ighter's
Challenge</i> is a new type of ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure. It is
designed especially for a Dungeon Master and one player - perfect for very small
playing groups, for those times when the whole group can't get together, or for
the player who wants his character to earn some extra experience. This adventure
will provide hours of excitement for the DM and any warrior or multi-class
fighter character of levels 2 to 4.<BR><BR><b>Y</b>ou can unravel a 40-year-old
mystery and restore the honor of Sturnheim - if you have the guts!
