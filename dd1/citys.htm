<center>Come to the city and take a look around!</center><BR><i>City
Sites</i>, the first in a series of AD&D game floorplans, includes
extensive details on urban settings that player characters are likely
to visit in any campaign. For instance, there's:<BR><BR>A smithy run
by gnomes<BR><BR>A temple that's home to an orphaned dragon<BR><BR>A
tavern that patrons can't enter until they give the password<BR><BR>
This book also describes two inns, a singing fountain, a jail, and much
more!<BR><BR>Each sites entry tells the Dungeon Master what the place
looks like at first glance and offers a detailed floorplan of the
interior as well as a picture of the exterior. Readers also find
fascinating notes about the characters who live and work in each site,
and one or two ideas for personalizing the spot to suit any adventure.<BR><BR>
From now on, make a trip to the city easy - and exciting!<BR><BR>Also in
this series of accessories: <a href="cast.htm"><i>Castle
Sites</i></a> and <a href="csites.htm"><i>Country Sites</i></a>.
