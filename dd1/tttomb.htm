The Autarch has a problem. His kingdom is on the brink of war, and his
royal viziers tell him the only hope for the future lies in gaining
three unique magical items, each of surpassing power. But the items
are held by guardians of such evil that the viziers tremble at the
though of facing one, let alone all three. Recovering those items means
almost certain death.<BR>The Autarch glances down at his desk, noting a
message from this morning. Spies report the arrival of adventurers,
ones of some renown. Instantly, he has the solution to his problem.
Adventurers can get those items. They'll do anything for money.<BR>
Even if it kills them.<BR><i>Temple, Tower, and Tomb</i> is a trio of
ruins to terrify the most courageous dungeon-crawler. This AD&D 2nd
Edition module can be fitted into almost any campaign or played as a
stand-alone adventure. And good luck - you'll badly need it.
