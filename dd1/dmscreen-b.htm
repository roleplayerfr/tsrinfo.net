This second edition of the Dungeon Masters Screen has been redesigned for
better clarity and quicker reference. This package consists of two durable,
11" x 25", folding cardstock screens for the DM's reference in playing
<b>ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS</b> games. One screen contains the Combat
and Saving Throw Tables and the other contains the Psionic Combat Tables
and miscellaneous information. These screens are useful for shielding
maps and other game materials from the players when placed upright, and
also provide instant reference to the charts and tables most commonly
used during play. The player's side is printed with Experience Tables
and the Weapons Table as well as being colorfully illustrated. These
folders have been varnished on both sides to protect tham against common
wear and tear. This (and only this) screen contains all the official
<b>AD&D</b> statistics and tables.<BR><BR>
