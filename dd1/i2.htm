will no longer run their caravans on the main highway past the quiet
village of Waycombe. The peasants are fleeing their lands, and all are
demanding protection from the powerful Count of Eor. The goodly count
has sent a troop of his trusted fighters to exterminate the brigands
believed responsible for these outrages, but weeks have passed, and still
there is no word from this force.<BR><BR>Now John Brunis, Count of Eor, has
turned to you for aiid. After taking counsel with the High Priest of
Eor, he believes that a small party of cunning, bold adventurers may
succeed where armed might has failed. You find yourselves faced with
many mysteries!<BR><BR>Why has robbery suddenly erupted in the peaceful
southlands?<BR><BR>How could mere brigands be as powerful as the foes
described to you by their numerous victims?<BR><BR>Is this really mere
robbery? Or is there some truth to the rumors, told only in hushed
whispers, about the beginnings of a hideous plot being hatched by an
ancient, vile and evil foe of all mankind?<BR><BR>The answers to these
mysteries will be found by only the most brave and cunning in this
extremely challenging adventure for characters levels 5-7.
