<center>A missing mage...<BR>A ruthless band of kidnappers...<BR>A
sinister conspiracy...<BR></center><i>Night Below</i>, the first epic campaign
adventure for the AD&D game, is designed to take the player characters
from 1st level to 10th level and beyond. The PCs start as beginning
adventures on a routine courier mission who soon become drawn into
combating a sinister plot that menaces the pleasant land of Haranshire.<BR><BR>

characters should have worked their way up to 5th level. Book II, <i>
Perils of the Underdark</i>, shifts the scene underground as the
characters search the seemingly endless realm of the underdark to
discover the fate of the kidnappers' victims. By the time they reach
the dark cavern of <i>The Sunless Sea</i> in Book III, they should
each be 10th level or above, ready at last to confront the ultimate
evil behind the far-reaching conspiracy.<BR><BR><center>Inside this box
