The kingdom of Tramilar was once a powerful state. Now, disease and
dissent have left the kingdom weak. The Dreadwoods on the kingdom's
northern border are a haunt for evil creatures and plots. Discord stalks
the very halls of the king. Only the bravest and most dedicated warrior
could overcome the obstacles hidden in the forest and lurking in the
throne room.<BR><BR><i>Fighter's Challenge II</i> is a special
ONE-ON-ONE ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure designed for a DUNGEON
MASTER and one player - perfect for very small groups, for those times
when the whole group can't get together, and for the player who wants
his or her character to earn some extra experience while playing the
role of a knight errant.<BR><BR>Can you survive the horrors of the
Dreadwoods? Are you ready to face treachery and deceit in high places?
Adventure and danger await around every bend in the trail!
