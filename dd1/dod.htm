giant has it. Do you have the gall or the guile to take it?<BR><i>

would solve many of King Oleg's problems, but reaching the dwarves is
eaiser said than done.<BR><i>Encounter in the Wildwood</i> by Willie
Walsh: A trek through the wood pits heroes against a truly monstrous

presented in <a href="rtd.htm"><i>Road to Danger</i></a>,
the first anthology of adventures taken from the pages of <i>Dungeon
Adventures</i>.
