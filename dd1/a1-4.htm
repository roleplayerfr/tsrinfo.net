Screams echo in the night, the charred remnants of a
village are mute by day. From the decaying lands of the Pomarj, slavers
have struck again!<BR>The adventure that began in the Temple of Elemental
Evil now sweeps southward across the Wild Coast and into the desolate
lands of the inhuman Pomarj. Slave raiders scour the countryside,
leaving death and destruction in their wake. Daring adventurers strike
into the heartland of the foe to harry the villains and bring retribution
and justice to the land.<BR>This product contains the completely revised
<i>Aerie of the Slavelords</i> series of adventures. Also included are new
challenges and new scenarios detailing the Wild Coast, the city of
Highport, the blasted lamds of the Pomarj and the Drachensgrab Mountains.<BR>
With the beginning found in <a href="t1-4.htm"><i>Temple of Elemental Evil</i></a>, your campaign
adventure can lead characters from 7th level all the way to 11th and
beyond! Hours of adventure and excitement lie between these covers.
