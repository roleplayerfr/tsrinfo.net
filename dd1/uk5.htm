Gazing down from the pinnacle of Hardway Mountain, who would not be
drawn by the far-off glint of the Serpent's Eye? The descent will be
hard, the mountain knows neither mercy nor compassion. Many are the
lessons to be learned, but fate has left you little choice - are you
equal to the challenge?<BR>Eye of the Serpent is a one-on-one
wilderness adventure module for one player and one Dungeon Master, and
has been designed to develop the specialist skills of a first level
druid, ranger, or monk character. It can also be used for a normal
party of 4-6 first level player characters.<BR>The perils of Hardway
Mountain are unchanging, but the routes between them are not. This
module includes a unique route planning system with different routes
linking the encounters to challenge the abilities of druids, rangers,
or monks. Alternately, Dungeon Masters can change the routings to
create their own original and exciting adventures.
