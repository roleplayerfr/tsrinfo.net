ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS PLAYER CHARACTER RECORDS are here! These
character records have been especially designed for use with ADVANCED
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS games and contains space for all information
commonly used by the player. This package contains multiple sheets of
each of five different character records, one for each of the major
character classes and their attendant subclasses: Fighter, Cleric,
Magic-user and Thief, with a fifth type for multiclassed characters and
Bards. What makes these records really special is their format. All
listings are organized under specific and easy-to-identify sections,
while the most vital and oft-consulted information is boxed with
eye-catching, easy-to-find devices to facilitate play. No more
searching for that important stat, as it is prominently displayed!<BR><BR>
On the front of these records is identification information, followed
by sections on abilities, combat and class specialties. On the back
are places carefully structured for possessions, wealth and experience,
as well as descriptions, friends and background. The sheets also leave
plenty of space for personal touches too.
