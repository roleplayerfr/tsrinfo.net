Back again, and better than ever! Virtually all the new AD&D game
monsters that were published by TSR in 1994 have growled, burrowed, and
slithered their way into this second release in a yearly series of
MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM supplements.<BR>More than 100 denizens of the land,
sky, sea, and... other places... are collected inside. Most of these
creatures originally appeared in a specific AD&D campaign setting, but
they've been updated and edited so they can be used in any campaign.<BR>
This year's collection also features the return of the long out-of-print
dinosaurs and pleistocene creatures, and includes general encounter
tables for the MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM books.<BR>This richly illustrated
book is an essential addition to every Dungeon Master's library.<BR><BR><BR>
