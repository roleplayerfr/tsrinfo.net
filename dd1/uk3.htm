Indomitable it stood for centuries, a symbol of order in a world of
chaos. Bastion of the pass through the Kamph Mountains, the very stones
of the Keep of Adlerweg were the stuff of legends. What evil power had
strength enough to take it? How were its defenses swept aside?<BR>Fell
creatures now attend the battlements that overlook the only pass
between Berghof and the sea.<BR>This is not a petty problem to be solved
by the militia of the local villages. These and more may be needed to
withstand the mayhem stirred up by the fall of the Keep. Indeed, if the
Keep is not retaken, and retaken soon, the Hold of the Sea Princess
itself may not be secure.<BR>Now is the time for heroic action. Aided
by te Sentinel, former protector of the legendary Guardians of Adlerweg,
have you the courage and determination to rid the Keep of its sinister
occupants?
