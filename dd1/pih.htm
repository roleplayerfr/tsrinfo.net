<i>Eternally does the Lord of Nessus scheme, and his designs are for all
eternity; In the pit of Hell do the devils teem round his throne, and
his reign is unchallenged; By the eight Dark Ones is he held supreme,
and his name (speak it not!) is Asmodeus.</i><BR>from "The Canticle of
Thumis," 142:15<BR>To some, justice is more important than glory, duty
is more important than desire, and goodness is more important than life.
The great paladin Klysandral was such a man.<BR>But even the sleep of
death, at the end of a long lifetime spent battling evil, did not
bring peace to Klysandral. During his funeral, the entire Temple of
Neheod was dragged by terrible magic into the Nine Hells, along with
the soul of Klysandral and score of living mourners!<BR>What unearthly
motive could be behind this tragedy? Only the bravest, strongest, and
most resolute heroes will have the mettle to fing the answer. Along
the way, they will meet the enigmatic wizard Emirikol the Chaotic, sail
aboard the fiendish ship <i>Demonwing</i>, and finally face the horrific
minions and overwhelming terrors of Hell itself.<BR>Only the path of
light can lead the bravest of the brave into perdition and safely out
again. Step wisely, and walk in justice.
