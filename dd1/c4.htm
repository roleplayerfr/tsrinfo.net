Two centuries ago, the last king of the celtic kingdom
of Pellham was deposed in favor of a High Council. Now, however, things
are going badly, and a restless populace longs for the days of the ancient
kingship. The High Council is floundering - and the political situation
is turning ugly.<BR>It was then that the Brothers of Brie, an obscure
monastic order, discovered a long-forgotten prophecy. In Pellham's time
of greatest need, a long-dead king will rise to restore order. You have
been chosen to prove that this is the time of the prophecy. You will
take the first steps toward returning the lost king to the throne.<BR>

BRIE series.<BR>This adventure
