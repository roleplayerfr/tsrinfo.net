Once a generation, they say, a strange comet appears in the sky overhead
and the gates of Firestorm Peak swing open. Twenty-seven years ago,
your father led his band of adventurers into the mysterious mountain,
never to return. Now the Dragon's Tear once more flickers in the sky,
and the glass gates on the mountainside beckon. Will you pass through
to discover the secrets that await beyond the portal none has ever
dared and returned?<BR><i>The Gates of Firestorm Peak</i> is the first
adventure designed especially for use with the new rules presented in
the three Player's Option books: <a href="ct.htm"><i>
Combat & Tactics</i></a>, <a href="sp.htm"><i>Skills &
Powers</i></a>, and <a href="sm.htm"><i>Spells & Magic</i></a>.
While it can also be played using just the AD&D game core rules (the <a href="phb2.htm"><i>
Player's Handbook</i></a> and the <a href="dmg2.htm"><i>
Dungeon Master Guide</i></a>), this adventure offers a perfect oppurtunity
to experience all the potential of the new optional rules. One of the
highlights of this package is the first Player's Option player character
record sheet.<BR>To meet the challenge of Firestorm Peak and escape
with their lives, heroic adventurers must battle dark dwarves in their
underground city, explore the abandoned caverns of the Elder Elves, and
deal with weird alien entities from Beyond. Their goal is to stop the
Master of the Twisted Caverns and his dark minions from completing his
sinister plot before it's too late...if they can.<BR>Included in this
product are a 96-page adventure book detailing the dungeon that lies
beneath Firestorm Peak, 4 full-color poster maps detailing all the
important locations in the complex, and a sheet of 56 counters for use
with the tactical maps in major combats.
