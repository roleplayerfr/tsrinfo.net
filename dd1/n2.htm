The land lies under a curse. Fruit drops to the ground, its pulp black
and rotten. Leaves curl and wither on the branches. Animals flee the
parched vale, or starve.<BR><BR>Long ago, the Downs prospered under the
care of Druids. But the priests of nature have retreated deep into the
woods and rarely show themselves. One old man claims that the Druids
have the power to save the valley, if only someone could find their
Oracle to seek help. Will you reach the Forest Oracle of the Druids in
time? And if you do, can they really lift the curse?<BR><BR>Or does the
answer lie elsewhere?<BR><BR>Only the most daring and cunning adventurers
will save the Downs. For character levels 2-4.
