Did you ever wonder what a phylactery is? Do you know what the
difference between a cloak and a robe is? <i>The Magic Encyclopedia</i>
answers these questions with succinct definitions of every type of item
found in a magical treasure hoard, and every definition has an
illustration.<BR>The list of definitions in Volume Two runs from Goggle
to Zwieback, and completes the list begun in <a href="me1.htm">
Volume One</a>. The listing includes an
experience point value and a gold piece sale value for each item. At
last, you'll know exactly what every bauble in any hoard is really worth.
The listing also identifies the product where
the item is described and the page number where you can find it. A
complete list of those products (current through December, 1991) is
also provided.
