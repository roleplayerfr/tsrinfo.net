Tired and sore, you struggle over the burning sands
towards the long-forgotten city. Will you reach the place in time to
save yourselves from the evil Efreeti? The sun beats down, making your
wounds stiff and worsening the constant thirst that plagues anyone who
travels these waterless wastes. But there is hope - are those the ruins
over there?<BR><BR>In the midst of broken columns and bits of rubble stands
a huge statue. This is the place! You've found it at last. Gratefully
you sink onto the sand. But there's no time to lose. You must hurry.
So with a quavering voice you say the magic words. And then you wait....<BR><BR>
A hush falls over the ruins, making the back of your neck prickle.
Then, out of the east, a wind rises, gentle at first but quickly growing
stronger and wilder, until it tears at your clothes and nearly lifts
you off your feet. The once clear sky iis choked with white and grey
clouds that clash and boil. As the clouds blacken, day turns to night.
Lightning flashes followed by a menacing growl of thunder. You are
beginning to wonder if you should seek shelter, when all of a sudden
there is a blinding crash and a bolt of lightning reduces the statue
to dust.<BR><BR>For a moment, silence. Then, out of the statue's remains,
soars a blue flame. Its roar deafens you as higher and higher it
climbs, until it seems about to reach the clouds. Just when you think
it can grow no larger, its shape begins to change. The edges billow
and soften, the roar lessens, and before your eyes materializes a
gigantic blue man.
