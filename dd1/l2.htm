"If you want someone murdered, go to Garrotten." It is a common saying
in Restenford. The small, peaceful town of Garrotten is rumored to be
the headquarters of a deadly band of assassins. Perhaps there is nothing
to this talk. Perhaps it is true. There has never been any reason to
find out. Until now...<BR><BR>The Baron of Restenford is dead.<BR><BR>The first
day following his death, Restenford was a hornet's nest of activity.
No one was allowed to enter or leave. The castle itself was sealed to
outsiders as soon as the murder was discovered. Wild rumors hinted
that the body was left in a condition that made magical restoration
impossible. That evening came an urgent summons from the reclusive
sorceror, Pelltar, whose council continued late into the night.<BR><BR>By
midmorning of the next day, you were well on your way to Garrotten.
Three slender clues are all that remain - three possible chances to
unravel the tangled web of intrigue that doomed the Baron of Restenford.
The sun is warm, and the land around you is full of life. By nightfall,
you will arrive.
