The dark jungle trees loom above you and the scent of tropical blooms
hangs heavy on the windless air. Overhead, brightly coloured birds
wheel and dip through the branches. Swarming mosquitos buzz angrily as
you raise a waterskin to your lips.<BR>Still you push on, carefully
following the riverbank and the fragment of your map. Those scraps of
parchment came from this jungle - of that you are sure - the carving
they had been carelessly wrapped around were the work of the local
natives. Now you have left those peaceful craftsmen far behind and the
map has led you to the uncharted territory of the murderous Atem.<BR>
Ahead the river breaks into white water. These must be the rapids
marked on the map. Reaching into your pouch, you draw out the fragments
of the parchment, and once again you mind drifts ahead to your
ultimate goal - the treasures promised at the journey's end. Riches!
And hopefully an end to this stifling, humid jungle.<BR>Can you unravel
the map's mysteries and find your way to the promised treasure? Or
will your dreams end only in death and an unmarked grave far from
home!<BR>Only the bravest characters of levels 5-7 will live to
discover that all that glitters is not gold, but much, much more!
