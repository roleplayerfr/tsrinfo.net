<i>This module was the official ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Tournament scenario at
Origins II. The author wishes to express his thanks to Mr. Robert
Kuntz who contributed substantial ideas for the various encounters
herein. This version has been carefully revised and updated to conform
to ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game systems. Included herein are background
information for players, statistics for a party substantially the same
as that used for the tournament, DM notes, six level maps with encounter
matrices, and numerous full color illustrations of scenes from the
adventure in order to enhance the enjoyment of participants. There are
also many new and special monsters designed for this scenario, and they
appear nowhere else. This module is located upon the Map of the World
of Greyhawk (WORLD OF GREYHAWK Fantasy Setting from TSR).</i><BR><BR><a href="s3-alt.htm">Click
