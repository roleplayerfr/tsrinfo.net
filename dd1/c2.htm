<i><b>A shadow from the past, the Ghost Tower of Inverness
has loomed ever larger in the mind of the great Seer of Urnst. Now he
has convinced the Duke that an expedition should be organized to go to
the ancient keep and recover its greatest treasure - the fabled Soul Gem.</b><BR><BR>
This module was originally written for the Official ADVANCED DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS Game Tournament at Wintercon VIII, held in Detroit in November of
1979. It is the second in TSR's COMPETITION SERIES - modules that were
used in official tournaments. This module contains a challenging setting,
a scoring system and characters specially prepared for this adventure.
It may thus be used for competition among players (or groups of players)
or as a non-scored adventure. Also included within are background
information, referee's maps and notes, encounter descriptions for
players, and a background scenario linked to the WORLD OF GREYHAWK
Fantasy World Setting.</i>
