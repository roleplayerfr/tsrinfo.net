<center>"...the Ultimate Campaign Adventure..."</center><BR><BR>
A sinister force, long though destroyed, stirs from the black hole that
spawned it. Like an ebony darkness it prowls the land and safety is
but an illusion, for it watches from every shadow and ponders
possibilities.<BR>What began years ago with the introduction of the
players to the quiet village of Hommlet and the amazing lands of
Greyhawk, at last is complete. Here is the long awaited campaign
adventure featuring the ruins of the Temple of Elemental Evil! Evil
broods and grows beneath those blasted stones. This is your chance to
drive it back and scatter its forces again.<BR>This product includes
the village of Hommlet, the filthy shire of Nulb, and reveals the ruins
of the Temple of Elemental Evil and the labyrinths that lie beneath, a
warren of darkness. And beyond these ruins, even more is revealed.<BR>
For the first time this product provides a complete campaign adventure
which will take beginning characters from 1st all the way to 8th level
and possibly beyond! Hours of adventuring await you!
