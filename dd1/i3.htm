Your skin was blistered all day before the hot desert
sun sank slowly below the horizon. Now, the deep blue mists of the
desert night swirl about you in the wind. The cool night air seems to
soak up the heat of the endless desert sands.<BR><BR>You shiver as you and
your friends huddle around your campfire, glancing nervously at the
giant pyramid in the distance. There is an eerie and mysterious feeling
about that place.<BR><BR>Gradually, the winds change direction, carrying a
thin streak of white mist that swirls into the shape of a faceless man
dressed in ancient robes. The moonlight seems to shine through him as
he raises his arms towards the pyramid and speaks.<BR><BR>"I am Pharaoh
Amun-re, son of Takosh-re of the House of Mo-pelar. I am now only a
shadow who has walked these sands for a thousand years in search of
wise and mighty warriors to break into my pyramid and plunder my tomb."<BR><BR>
The winds shift again; his robes begin to swirl about him and he fades
back into the mists and winds. Why does this desert spirit want you to
plunder his tomb? Can you survive the challenges of a pyramid that has
stood for a thousand years? Or are you being led into a trap?
