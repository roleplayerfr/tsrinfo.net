Do you still have that certain magical potion or did your character
drink it last week?<BR>These questions, and many more, can be answered
when you fill out your all new AD&D 2nd Edition Character Record Sheet.
Record your character's ability scores, possessions, background, and
much, much more!<BR>And the new record sheets are formatted more clearly
