<center>When treason walks the land...</center><BR><BR>The kingdom of Dunador is in trouble.
Since the king, Halfred of Dunthrane, was killed in a hunting accident,
the land has hovered on the brink of civil war. Crown Prince Edmund,
at 18 only half-trained and quite unprepared to assume the throne, has
yet to be crowned. Currently he is on a pilgrimage to the holy shrine
of Nevron in the province of Andevar. While the uncrowned king is far
from home, anarchy reigns in Dunador.<BR>Throughout the realm, plots
are brewing and evil hands are eagerly clutching the sword of treason.
Inevitably the focus of these intrigues is in the troubled province of
Andevar to the north. For it is here that the young Prince has
journeyed and here that he must be crowned.<BR>In this dark hour Dunador
has but one faithful servant: Hollend, chief advisor to the old king.
Painfully aware of all that is at stake, Hollend has sought the aid of
a brave party of adventurers in a desperate bid to tip the scales in
favor of truth and justice. But, even as the party secretly enters
Andevar, the forces of evil strike with blinding speed and ruthless
determination.<BR><BR>Click <a href="dest.htm">here</a>
