Deal a dungeon? Deal a castle? Deal rooms with magical items, monsters,
and danger lurking behind every table, box, and bookcase? The <b>AD&D
CARDMASTER Adventure Design Deck</b> is an exciting new tool for DMs,
and a thrilling new game for players. DMs will use the Adventure
Design Deck to create dramatic settings for their adventures. Players
can use Cardmaster to go a-questing with a DM. Even solo adventures
are possible, just by shuffling the cards.<BR><BR>108 Location Cards
depict unique and mysterious rooms and corridors on three dungeon
levels. And on all levels are treasures to be found and monsters to
be conquered. The Treasure Deck contains 54 cards full of loot and
magical items. Explore each room for treasure, but beware of traps!
And beware of the 54 different monsters with their own traps and
snares, nesting in their own Deck. They are waiting for you... and
some of them are hungry!
