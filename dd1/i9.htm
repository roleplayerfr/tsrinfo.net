The land of Arir - a once peaceful desert country,
dotted with oases, teeming with caravans - fell into the hand of infidels.
The ruler, the dearly loved Sultan Amhara, was killed in the battle for
the capital city of Khaibar. He left behind one of the greatest
treasure stores ever amassed - jewels and coins, more than anyone had
ever seen before or since - and in addition, the Cup and Talisman of
Al'Akbar.<BR><BR>A deadly plague sweeps your land. The holy men say that if
only they had the Talisman, they could create cures for this dread
disease. Many adventurers have tries and failed to find the Cup and
Talisman. Now it is your turn. Find these treasures, and save your
people!<BR><BR>The journey is exciting, but treacherous. Do not be distracted
by exotic sights and sounds, the strange foods. You must avoid being
discovered by Al'Farzikh and his brigands, as you infiltrate the palace.
Be wary - what is most beautiful may be most deadly, and what seems
useless may be priceless.
