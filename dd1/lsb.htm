Long ago the Lords of Chaos strove with the forces of Law and were
defeated. Their great temple destroyed and their minions scattered to
the four winds, the Chaos Lords withdrew, and a new balance held sway
in the land. But prophecy said that one day the fallen temple would
rise again, heralding the Lords' return to spread Chaos across the world
once more.<BR>And now comes a cry for help from the dwarves of Isar,
saying that the Lost Shrine has risen from beneath the dark waters of
the lake that kept it hidden for thirteen centuries. Already forces are
gathering - some eager to plunder the temple's legendary treasures,
some wishing to join under the Chaos Lords' banner, some desperate to
destroy the shrine before the world they know is swept away.<BR>"Find
the Chaos Key," says the prophecy. "The hand that holds the Key may
shape the future." But will you be in time to be the one?
