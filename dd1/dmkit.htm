As any good Dungeon Master knows, preparation is the key to a great
adventure. The more work done in advance, the smoother the play session
will go. And nothing turns players off faster than a DM fumbling for
the right piece of information in the middle of a fast-paced session.<BR><BR>
That's where the <i>Dungeon Master's Design Kit</i> comes in. Inside
its 96 time-saving pages are scores of organizational ideas, refereeing
hints, and ready-to-use materials that will make you a better-prepared,
better-organized, and just plain <i>better</i> Dungeon Master - without
spending a lot of extra time you don't have!<BR><BR>The <i>Dungeon
Master's Design Kit</i> includes a 32-page book of forms, designed to
keep important information together and at your fingertips. A number
of difficult refereeing situations are covered, including the chase
scene, one of the toughest AD&D game situations to judge. Another
32-page book contains the "DM's Cookbook," full of ready-to-go
ingredients that you can combine in a flash to spice up your campaign.
The last book puts the package all together, including loads of
practical advice on becoming a better DM.<BR><BR>So pick up the
<i>Dungeon Master's Design Kit</i>, harried DM - and watch your AD&D
campaign take off!
