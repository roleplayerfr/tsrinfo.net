<i>It is time to put a stop to the marauders! For years
the coastal towns have been burned and looted by the forces of evil.
You and your fellow adventurers have been recruited to root out and
destroy the source of these raids. But beware, hundreds of good men and
women have been taken by the slavers and have never been seen or heard
from again!<BR><BR>This modules was originally used for the official ADVANCED
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Tournament at GenCon XIII and is the first of four
in a series of related tournament modules from TSR.<BR><BR>This module
contains a challenging scenario, the tournament scoring system plus nine
pre-rolled, playtested tournament characters. Also included are large
scale referee's maps, notes, and background information. A1 is a complete
adventure in itself, but it is also a companion to <a href="a2.htm">A2 (Secret of the
Slavers' Stockade)</a>, <a href="a3.htm">A3 (Assault on the Aerie of the Slave Lords)</a>, and
<a href="a4.htm">A4 (In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords)</a>. Be sure to look for other
exciting adventure modules from the Game Wizards at TSR.</i>
