Get out of town and into the world!<BR><i>Country Sites</i>, the third
in a series of AD&D game accessories, is a compendium of challenging
and distinctive settings that will test the mettle of any group of player
characters. Herein is all the information a Dungeon Master needs to
build adventures within these settings and incorporate them into an
existing campaign: background information, maps, location descriptions,
and summary profiles of the unusual characters who populate these
strange places.<BR>Take your characters into the "City of the Dead."
See if they come overcome the obstacles of "Darian's Wall," or arrange
for them to pay a visit to "The Place of Broken Dreams." Every one of
the 11 <i>Country Sites</i> in this 96-page book will open new vistas
for adventuring in (and sometimes under) the great outdoors.<BR>Previous
books in this series include <a href="citys.htm"><i>City
Sites</i></a> and <a href="cast.htm"><i>Castle Sites</i></a>.
