<i>Somewhere in the heart of the steaming jungle lies the
answer to the whispered tales - rumors of a magnificent city and foul,
horrid rituals! Here a brave party might find riches and wonders - or
death! Is your party brave enough to face the terrors of the unknown
and find - the Forbidden City!<BR><BR>Parts of this module were used in 1980
for a major East Coast convention tournament. Information is presented
here to reconstruct this exciting tournament and even more has been
given to expand play. Here characters may adventure several times in a
unique and interesting mini-campaign. Included in this module are
background and tournament notes, referee's keys, new monsters, pre-
generated characters, and eight different maps.</i>
