Look what's here! Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Permanent Character
Folder and Adventure Records especially designed for use with Advanced
Dungeons & Dragons games! These two interlocking products have been
designed to eliminate those major problems which commonly plague other
character records, space and durability. Organized into a special
format, information is grouped together under specific and easy-to-identify
sections, while the most vital and oft-consulted information is boxed
with eye-catching, easy-to-find displays.<BR>All information which
remains constant for a character, as well as sufficient space for
record-keeping, are provided for on the durable four-pages of the
Permanent Character Folder, while all information subject to change
during an adventure is recorded on seperate Adventure Records. When
an adventure is ended the completed record may be stored in the Permanent
Character Folder to serve as a file on past deeds of glory. If you
