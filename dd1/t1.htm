<i>The Village of Hommlet has grown up around a crossroads in a woodland.
Once far from any important activity, it became embroiled in the
struggle between gods and demons when the Temple of Elemental Evil
arose but a few leagues away. Luckily for its inhabitants, the Temple
and its evil hordes were destroyed a decade ago, but Hommlet still
suffers from incursions of bandits and strange monsters...<BR><BR>This
module contains a map of the village and lands around, a large scale
map of the inn, church, trading post, and guard tower (main floor,
upper rooms and cellars), and informational key regarding the inhabitants,
and a map and exploration key for a destroyed moat house, a former
outpost of the Temple of Elemental Evil. The whole provides a complete,
ready-to-play scenario, and is a lead-in to DUNGEON MODULE T2, THE
TEMPLE OF ELEMENTAL EVIL.</i><BR><BR><a href="t1-alt.htm">Click
