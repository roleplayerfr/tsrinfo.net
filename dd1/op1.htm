Has reality got you down? Tired of everyday, humdrum, commonplace
happenings of life on the Prime Material Plane? Want to <i>really</i>
get away from it all? Then step right up for the chance for adventure
out of the ordinary...<i>way</i> out of the ordinary...<BR>Tales of the
Outer Planes is an anthology of short adventures set throughout the
many Outer Planes for use with the <a href="planes.htm">
AD&D Manual of the Planes</a>. Some of gaming's best designers have
contributed adventures to this set, which includes scenarios set in the
Seven Heavens, Olympus, the four Elemental Planes, the Nine Hells, and
the Astral and Ethereal Planes. Tales of the Outer Planes is a perfect
collection for powerful characters who have it too easy at home and are
looking for new challenges. Many of the most fearsome monsters are
even more dangerous on their own planes - can you take them on and live
to tell the tale?<BR>These adventures can be inserted as a "change of
pace" in an existing campaign, or can be the foundation of an entire
new set of adventures. Either way, Tales of the Outer Planes will be
sure to open up a whole new frontier for AD&D game players everywhere.
