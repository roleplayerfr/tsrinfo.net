A strangely delivered advertisement has led you to a
sage named Demetrios. He needs a rare component to complete a desperately
needed potion. The journey to retrieve it will take you through a
large, unexplored swamp to a ruined keep, the former headquarters of a
vile cult that once claimed the lives of many innocent youths.<BR>You
cautiously accept the mission. But who knows what monsters lurk in the
vast marsh? Are the old ruins occupied, perhaps by things even more
dangerous than the previous residents? Beware, for the eerie green
light shining upward from the central tower, the beacon that guides
your way, may attract others as well. To succeed, you must penetrate
the keep and find a unique Black Flame worshipped by the old cult.
Could those evil ones be lurking about still? You will know soon....<BR>
To solve the mysteries of <i>Baltron's Beacon</i>, the characters must excel in
handling wilderness, building ruins, dungeons, traps, puzzles, and new
monsters. This adventure, originally designed for tournament use, is
now available for your own campaign.<BR><BR>An Adventure for 5-10 Characters,
