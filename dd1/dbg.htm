You are probably wondering: Is this guidebook for me? In a word - yes!
<i>Dungeon Builder's Guidebook</i> assembles tried-and-true dungeon
building advice, approaches, and tactics gathered over many years. The
suggestions and samples in this book are an invaluable resource for
initiating and fleshing out the ruins, mines, caverns, and tombs of
your imagination.<BR>What if you already design all your own dungeons?
Though the advice and tips in here may be old news to you, even the
most experienced Dungeon Master is sometimes strapped for time or
inspiration. <i>Dungeon Builder's Guidebook</i> is perfect for
generating the dungeon hook you need at a moment's notice, the goblin
warren the PCs accidentally stumble upon, or the pocket dimension you
did not get a chance to detail.<BR><i>Dungeon Builder's Guidebook</i>
contains the following features:<BR>Basic pointers and advice on
building dungeons.<BR>Permutations that provide ways to "twist" your
dungeon in exciting ways.<BR>Six distinct dungeon types, each
accompanied by property and encounter tables to help you flesh out your
dungeon.<BR>A collection of 78 geomorphs that you can photocopy, trace,
or freehand onto your own maps.<BR>The Trap Architect, a detailed
process for generating lethal traps.<BR>The Autodungeon Engine, a series
of tables that allow you to create a dungeon by attaching random
geomorphs together, forming a unique dungeon each time.<BR><i>Dungeon
Builder's Guidebook</i> follows and complements <a href="wbg.htm"><i>
World Builder's Guidebook</i></a>, focusing on specific sites rather
than global design.<BR>The tools are now yours. What are you going to
build?
