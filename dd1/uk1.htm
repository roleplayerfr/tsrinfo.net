Fleeing the rage that consumed their feuding families, Juliana and
Orlando fled to the Cave of Echoes, where it is said every wish is
granted. Two years have passed, and all attempts to return the lovers
to their parents have failed, though some believe them lost in the
enchanted garden beyond the cave. Many are the rescuers venturing into
that enchanted park; a few have returned after long absences, their
minds and memories curiously disturbed. Now, the handsome reward
offered for the return of the lovers has tempted you, but who knows
what lies beyond the Crystal Cave?
