<i>"Evil is seeping from the earth!"</i><BR>-Old Two Fingers<BR>From
time out of mind, the standing stones known as the Circle of
Cahervaniel have stood lonely vigil on a grassy hilltop. Sheepherders
once moved their flocks over the hill and through the circle, sometimes
resting in the cool shadows cast by the ancient stones.<BR>Everything
changed when a stone finger fell, revealing a fissure in the earth.
Now, dark shadows caress the circle after the sun sets. Creatures out
of nightmare dance upon the hillside at night. Many swear that a
unicorn of deepest ebony now hunts all upon two legs who draw near,
while stunted creatures scurry in the shadows, abducting sheep from
their sheds and drawing them down below ground for food.<BR>After the
disappearance of a sheperd, fear grows stronger in neighboring
villages. Who will brave the black hollow of the ancient Circle of
Cahervaniel? Heroes of stern mettle must descend into the cavity and
explore the ancient spaces existing there.<BR><i>The Shattered Circle</i>
is a stand-alone adventure in which low-level characters explore an
ancient dungeon long hidden below the ground. Accomplished players
with new characters will find this adventure fun and challenging, but
it can also serve as a beginner's first taste of the AD&D game.
