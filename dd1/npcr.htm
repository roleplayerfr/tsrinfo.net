At last, record sheets for non-player characters! Advanced Dungeons &
Dragons Non-player Character Records are especially designed for
Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. No longer will the DM need to worry about
lack of continuity or lost records on non-player characters, for these
sheets provide the DM with easy-to-store records of many non-player
personalities which populate his or her campaign.<BR>These convenient
referee aids contain all information needed to run each non-player
character and his, her or its personal background. The sheets have
been organized under specific headings and important, oft-consulted
information is boxed in eye-catching, easy-to-find displays. These
records contain information on the character's abilities, combat skills,
description, posessions and background. Compact, but complete, their
small size provides easy handling and more sheets. If you enjoy this
