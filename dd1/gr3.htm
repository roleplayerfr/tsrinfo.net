Hunt for lost gold, powerful magic items, and even greater treasure!<BR><BR>
<b>Treasure Maps</b> contains 16 seperate adventures that will take
player characters from mountaintops to the ocean depths. The player
characters can find treasure drowned in deep water, watch the stars for
omens, rescue a kidnapped prince, search for a lost mine, visit a very
strange restaurant, or explore the sky-temple of a forgotten deity.
But beware! The greater the treasure-hoard, the greater the danger
from its guardians.<BR><BR>Each adventure comes with two beautifully
rendered full-color maps, one for the players and one for the DUNGEON
MASTER. Also provided are rumors associated with each map and encounter
notes for the DM. These adventures are adaptable for play in any AD&D
game world, either as a brief encounter or as the start of a
full-fledged campaign. The DM can also use any of the 32 full-color
maps to create adventures of his or her own.
