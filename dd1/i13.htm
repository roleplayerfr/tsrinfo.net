DMs, do you wish you had more time to put together
fresh, innovative adventures for your players? Have you ever been
stuck for a new plot line, but been unwilling to delve into the reading
and prepartion required by full-length modules?<BR>TSR Inc. proudly
presents a new AD&D game accessory designed for the DM who wants variety
and challenge for player characters. <i>Adventure Pack I</i> contains 12 short
modules, each a complete stand-alone adventure. The scenarios are
unique and unusual; they will intrigue characters of all levels, and
offer a variety of settings and plots for the DM to choose from.<BR>
These adventures are suitable for one-time play, or can be inserted into
your campaign at any time. Each module includes one or more maps,
background for the DM, NPC capsules, and complete encounter descriptions.
The scenarios are designed for a specific range of player character
levels, and can easily be made more or less difficult if neccessary.
Now, with a minimum of preparation, you can give your player characters
a challenge that will last for as little as one day of game time or
months of it. DMs are sure to find <i>Adventure Pack I</i> convenient,
innovative, and invaluable!
