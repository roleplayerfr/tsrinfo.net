Nine hundred years ago, the Dark Ages ended. But a new and terrible
age then began, one of brutality and heroism, terror and courage,
glorious victory and disastrous defeat. Western Europe turned its eyes
eastward toward the Holy Land, and moved to take it from the Saracens.
But the forces of Islam would have none of this, and under the call of
<i>jihad</i> they arose to meet the invaders.<BR><i>The Crusades</i>
presents the land of Outremer as a powerful AD&D setting, with
historical background, maps, new character kits, details on strange
magic and fantastic beasts, and adventures. It is a violent and
dangerous world, but one of promise and hope as well. Only the brave
need come.
