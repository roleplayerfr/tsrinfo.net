Looking for oppurtunity and fresh pickings, a rogue hops a ship for new
lands, only to leap from the frying pan into the fire. The ship is
attacked on the high seas by a band of blood-thirsty pirates, and the
rogue washes up on the Isle of Beacon Point...right at the center of
the pirate's sphere of influence. Can this single character stay alive
with no more than wits and hard-earned thieving skills, escape the
island, and possibly even bring down the pirates?<BR><BR>Thief's
Challenge II: Beacon Point is a special ONE-ON-ONE ADVANCED DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS adventure designed for a Dungeon Master and one player character
thief of levels 4 to 6. It is the seventh in a series of independent
adventures focusing on an individual character of a specific class.
