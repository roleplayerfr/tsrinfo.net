The king's notice asked for adventurers to undertake a
mission to a far land. It was marked with the rune for "high danger,
high reward" so of course you volunteered.<BR><BR>The king has heard of a
great obelisk that towers over a ruined city in a far country. He wants
to know more about the obelisk and its strange powers. Your job is to
find the obelisk and bring back a report to the king. The mission seems
absurdly easy...until you reach the jungle.<BR><BR>Don't think the king is
through with you if you get back to the capital city alive. You haven't
seen the last of that jungle yet. Is a share in the spoils of an
ancient civilization worth the risk?<BR><BR>Don't forget to pack you bug
repellent!
