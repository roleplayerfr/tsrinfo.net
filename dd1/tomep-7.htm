Take your spellcasters to limits they have never reached before! With
over two hundred new spells and magical items, the <i>Tome of Magic</i>

Game.<BR>In these pages are new forms of wizard magic including
elementalists, metamagic, and wild magic, plus expansions of existing
schools. For priests, whole new spheres have been discovered - spheres
of chaos, law, numbers, thought, time, war, and wards - and powerful
new quest spells lie waiting to be tapped.<BR>All characters will
experience the thrill of discovering new magical items such as the <i>
claw of magic stealing, dimensional mine, crystal parrot, ring of
randomness, and staff of the elements. Tome of Magic</i> is an
invaluable expansion for all the spellcasting classes!
