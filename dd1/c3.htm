It is terribly cold. You swam for your life to this
mysterious island, losing most of your provisions in the process, only
to find it barren of all but grass. A biting wind from the north drives
through your wet clothes, chilling you to the bone. Night is falling
and promises even colder temperatures; you wish this place had even a
bush to burn as firewood. Your stomach has just begun to complain about
the lack of dinner, when one of your companions calls, and you rush to
his side, hoping he's found a way to turn grass into a sandwich. Instead,
he points to the ground in front of him, "Look there."<BR>Set in a shallow
depression in the ground is a stone door. Your friend reaches down and
gives a tug, and the door swings slowly open on creaking hinges, revealing
a descending stair. The first thought that crosses your mind is wheter
it would be better to freeze to death up here in the wind or fall into
the hands of Castanamir the Mad, the unpredictable.<BR>This adventure
is for use with the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS rules. This adventure
cannot be played without the AD&D rules produced by TSR, Inc.
