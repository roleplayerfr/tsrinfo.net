Look to your weapons! Here comes a horde of the strangest creatures
ever to inhabit the worlds of the AD&D game. The denizens of the
original <a href="ff.htm">FIEND FOLIO</a> tome are back,
updated and expanded for the AD&D 2nd edition game. Treat yourself to
an in-depth look at the peculiar achaierai, vicious stilt-legged birds
that roam the infernal planes - and they also hunt closer to civilization.
Find out what xvarts do for fun, but don't expect them to play fair!
The menagerie inside includes leaping gambados, grenzied gorbels, and
other old favorites. Several brand new creatures, such as the beautiful
but haughty gem dragons join them. Don't pass up your cance to get to
know these astonishing creatures.
