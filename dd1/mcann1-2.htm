They're ba-ack! Virtually all of the monsters that appeared in TSR's
1993 AD&D product line, plus many of those that appeared in the '93
issues of Dragon, Dungeon, and Polyhedron Magazines, are brought
together in this first release in an annual series of Monstrous
Compendium supplements.<BR><BR>This book is crawling with more than 100
denizens of the land, sky, sea, and underdark, waiting to creep into the
nearest adventure. Creatures within these pages have appeared in the
<a href="../fr/fr.htm">Forgotten Realms</a> campaign setting,
the <a href="../aq/aq.htm">Al-Qadim</a> world of adventure,
the <a href="../rv/rv.htm">Ravenloft</a> world of horror, the
<a href="../ds/ds.htm">Dark Sun</a> game world, and even the
Outer and Inner Planes, but they've been reorganized, updated, and
edited so they can be used in any campaign. An introduction explaining
how to breathe life into random encounters is included too.<BR><BR>
Every illustration is brand new and presented in full color, so these
monsters are more lifelike than ever before! This is a must-have item
for all serious Dungeon Masters.<BR><BR><BR><a href="mcann1-1.htm">
