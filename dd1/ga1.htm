<b>Comments:</b> The lgendary coastal city of Carsall existed two centuries
ago - before it vanished beneath the waves, reputedly at the hands of an
angry sea god. Stories of the city and tales of fabulous artifacts
originating from Carsall still abound. Now, the clerics of a seaside
town have proven that some unusual items are indeed from the legendary
city - and two priests involved in the process, as well as a mysterious
stranger, are missing.<BR><BR>Are player characters willing to risk life and
breath beneath the water to find the lost city? Does the city truly
exist, or is the story simply a hoax put forth by crooked fishermen?
Take the plunge - explore The Murky Deep.
