Secrets of priests and temples - revealed at last!<BR>Who are the priests
your player characters turn to for cures and healing? What is the
temple like where they line up for holy water? What is the patron
church for the zealous party paladin? Where did your party's clerics
and priests train, and where do they go when the time comes to learn
higher mysteries? <i>Bastion of Faith</i> has answers to these
questions and many more!<BR><i>Bastion of Faith</i> presents a complete
temple of priests and affiliates (holy warriors, devout rogues, and
pious wizards) that can be placed into any campaign or adventure.
<i>Bastion of Faith</i> follows the format of the popular <a href="den.htm"><i>
Den of Thieves</i></a> and <a href="cow.htm"><i>College
of Wizardry</i></a> sourcebooks. This 96-page book contains:<BR>A
complete roster of the priests and affiliates of the temple called the
Bastion of Faith, including detailed descriptions for the temple's
upper hierarchy.<BR>Rules for incorporating nonpriest characters into
the temple as affiliates.<BR>Maps of the temple, its public spaces...and
the tainted catacombs beneath it.<BR>New priest spells and blessed
magical items.<BR>Four mini-adventures for priest or nonpriest characters.<BR>
The full story behind the Bastion's "Secret Doctrine" and the
consequences for the temple should the truth ever get out!
