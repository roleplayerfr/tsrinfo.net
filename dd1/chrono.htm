You have all the time in the world - and now you don't.<BR>The final
and most dangerous fantasy frontier lies not in space, but in <i><b>time!</b></i>
At last, the dimension of Time is open to those few wizards who would
risk everything - even their very existence - to visit ancient and
forgotten lands, or see the unbelievable wonders and horrors of the
future. These few wizards are <i>Chronomancers</i>, and this
optional 96-page AD&D game accessory reveals the secrets of their lives.
New spells, new powers, and new realms - as well as terrifying monsters -
are brought to light in this stunning work. Take time to study the
mysteries of chronomancy - before someone else takes that time from you.
