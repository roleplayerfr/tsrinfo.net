The power of prophecy is given to few. Wise are they who guard this
gift well, for those who thirst after such knowledge are not always men
of principle.<BR>Bastion of destiny, the Tower of the Heavens stands
silhouetted against the star-studded night sky. From within his
darkened observatory, perched like an eyrie on the highest turret, a
figure in white charts the course of a shooting-star as it disappears
behind the snow-capped peaks of the Tegefed mountains.<BR>The old man
smiles grimly to himself; the event foretold has come to pass!<BR>
Power, glory, riches - it takes years to acquire them. The uncanny
accuracy of their predictions has brought all these and more to the
sages of the Tower of the Heavens. But what is hard to win is often
easier to lose, and the future of the tower now hangs in the balance.<BR>
For it is written that the day of reckoning draws nearer when a star
falls....
