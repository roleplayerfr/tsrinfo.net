For years, trade and travel along the river Thadysh have been peaceful.
Suddenly a masked renegade, known only as the Gullwing Bandit, has
turned the waters of Thadysh into a pirate stream! Who is this bandit?
What nefarious plot is he weaving? Not even the local thieve's guild
has been able to unveil the truth.<BR><BR><i>Thief's Challenge</i> is a
special ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure designed for a DUNGEON
MASTER and one player character: a thief. It's a perfect break from
group play, tailored to the character who's seeking some extra
experience. Suited to clever beginners as well as more experienced
rogues, <i>Thief's Challenge</i> lets a thief take full advantage of
his special talents.<BR><BR>Can you unmask the Gullwing Bandit? The
reward is great, but beware: adventure and danger await at every turn
of the river!
