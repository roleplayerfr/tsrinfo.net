<b>Comments:</b> Excitement and unrest grip the land of Pellham. Two
hundred years ago, the royal line of kings was deposed and replaced by
a High Council. The current council is well-meaning but hopelessly
incompetent. Everyone agrees that a drastic change is needed for the
kingdom to survive.<BR>The ancient Prophecy of Brie foretells that in
Pellham's darkest hour, a king from the past will return to restore the
kingdom. The time of the prophecy is now.<BR>All is in readiness: the
symbols of the ancient kings have been recovered, the keys to the royal
tomb are in hand, powerful magics to revive the long-dead king have been
secured at great cost. Only one problem remains...no one knows where
the king is buried!<BR>The Bane of Llywelyn concludes the epic adventure
of the Prophecy of Brie - can YOU insure that the quest will be a success?<BR><BR>
The adventure can be played as a seperate adventure or as the second part
of the <i>Prophecy of Brie</i> series.<BR><BR>This adventure
is for use with the ADVNACED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game and cannot be
played without the AD&D rules produced by TSR, Inc.
