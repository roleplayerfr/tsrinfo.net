Beware of Baba Yaga and her infamous hut!<BR>Baba Yaga is an ancient
crone who is said to have power over day and night itself. Many seek
out Baba Yaga for her wisdom, which she has gleaned from centuries of
travel through numerous worlds. Others, bolder and more foolish, search
out the hut to plunder its treasures, which Baba Yaga has gathered from
every corner of the multiverse. None, thief or scholar, who enter the
Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga leave unscathed.<BR>How will you fare now that
the great Baba Yaga is in your neighborhood?
