Storms frequently blown from the Cloudscape Mountains, but never one
like this. For weeks it has hung over the peaks, casting its dark
shadow across the land. Its huge black clouds billow and writhe in an
effort to smother the sun. Once so picturesque and enchanting, the
Cloudscape Mountains have taken on a sinister appearance.<BR>Fear now
stalks the land. A malignant entity is growing and festering high in
the mountain peaks. With dark tendrils it reaches out towards the
lowlands. No one is safe, caravans are not arriving at the village of
Lurneslye. It is only a matter of time before the villagers fall prey
to the dark and the evil they conceal.<BR>Powerful adventurers of levels
7-9, are urgently sought to banish the darkness. The sun must again
shine in a clear blue sky and soon. Once the dark clouds have fully
gathered, who knows what may be unleashed across the land?
