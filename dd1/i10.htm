<i>"I AM THE ANCIENT ... I AM THE LAND ..."</i><BR><BR>Your screams still
echo in your room. Cold sweat soaks the bedsheets and trickles down your
back.<BR>It seemed so real! The great towers of a darksome place called
Ravenloft ... it's misty vales and the terrible tragedy of a man who had
sold his soul to unlife. Now the sunlight streams through the window
with the promise of a new day. The dread nightmare at last is over.<BR>
In the cold sunlight of a dying autumn, you step from your room at the inn
and stroll along the friendly streets of Mordentshire. But, from the back
of your mind the dream creeps forward to haunt you. Why do the faces of
those who have befriended you now seem those of strangers? Why do those
who called you here in terror, now seem to dismiss your task as a folly?<BR>
More .. why are you advised so strongly, to forget about the House on
Gryphon Hill ... the domain of the fair haired Count Von Zarovich, a name
that cries out from your dark nightmare?<BR>You halt, as the swirl of
events grow more confusing with every passing minute. Which is the dream
... and which the reality?<BR><BR><center>This adventure is for use with
the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game and cannot be played without the
AD&D rules produced by TSR Inc.</center>
