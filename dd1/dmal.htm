Here's the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Masters Adventure Log,
the second playing aid designed specifically for the DM of Advanced
Dungeons & Dragons! No longer need the DM rely on memory and sketchy
notes to keep track of one's players in the midst of play. Now all the
information needed about the adventurers and their exploits can be
kept handy in front of the DM at all times.<BR>The Dungeon Masters
Adventure Log contains two different sheets (shown on the back cover).
The first type is for recording information about the adventurers,
their hit points, armor class, magic items and die roll adjustments.
The second provides information on the marching order of the party,
the monsters they encounter, treasures they recover, and any unusual
events that occur. In addition, this book contains many important
tables in an easy reference form, including tables for experience
point awards, encounter reactions, movement, surprise, listening, and
a new table of collected combat modifiers.
