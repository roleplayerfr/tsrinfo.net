The moon rises, and you feel yourself start to change. Fur sprouts
from your palms, your fingers turn to claws, and a howl rips from your
throat. Your clothes shred and tear as your Other Self breaks free....<BR>
<i>Moonlight Madness</i> follows the exploits of six unlucky heroes
trying to free themselves of the curse of lycanthropy while evading a
full-scale werewolf hunt lead by a crusading paladin and his doughty
army. Hermits, sphinxes, dinosaurs, pixies, Amazons, bandits, and a
friendly game of "Dwarfenball" are only a few of the challenges that
stand between the heroes and the cure they seek. Will they reach the
Hermitage on the Lake in time, or succumb to Moonlight Madness?
