This ALL NEW edition of the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Player Character

and changed over the years. Now your character sheet can keep up to
date with the game. These NEW Character Records are now compatible for
use with <a href="ua.htm">UNEARTHED ARCANA</a> and <a href="oa.htm">
ORIENTAL ADVENTURES</a>.<BR><BR>On the front of these records are sections
for all the information most often used during play and combat. On the
back are places for records, possessions and personal backgrounds. In
addition, sets of Spellbook Planner Sheets have been included for Magic
Users, Illusionists, Clerics, Druids, Shukenja and Wu Jen, as well as
Cantrips. These Planner Sheets recap all the vital spell statistics in
