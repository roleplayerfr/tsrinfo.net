This module was created by Robert Kuntz (one of the original founders
of D&D), and was to be published by his company, Creations Unlimited
(who previously published <b>Garden of the Plantmaster</b> and the four
modules in the <b>Zayene</b> series). The company unfortunately went
out of business, and the planned series of RPGA modules based on the
City of Brass never saw the light of day. Kuntz released this first
module to the Internet some years ago, where it has been floating
ever since. It is freely distributable, provided it is kept intact
and in its entirety.
