The secrets of the spirit world unveiled for the first time!<BR>There
is a world unseen by mortals, a world filled with invisible beings that
whisper words unheard by all - all but the shaman. The shaman alone
knows how to listen for the spirits, and the shaman alone knows their
secrets.<BR>This 96-page AD&D game accessory introduces three new
priest classes with unique powers and exciting potential. More subtle
and versatile than clerics and wizards, the shamans tap the energies
of the mysterious spirit world, using their extraordinary abilities to
further their personal goals, as well as the agendas of their unseen
spirit patrons.<BR><i>Shaman</i> offers complete information on the new
classes, tips for incorporating them into established campaigns, new
skills, new spells, and a detailed look at the unseen world of spirits.
