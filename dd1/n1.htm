<i>Terror by night! The village of Orlane is dying. Once a small and
thriving community, Orlane has become a maze of locked doors and
frightened faces. Strangers are shunned, trade has withered. Rumors
flourish, growing wilder with each retelling. Terrified peasants flee
their homes, abandoning their farms with no explanation. Others simply
disappear...<BR><BR>No one seems to know the cause of the decay - why are
there no clues? Who skulks through the twisted shadows of the night?
Who or what is behind the doom that has overtaken the village? It will
take a brave and skillful band of adventurers to solve the dark riddle
of Orlane!<BR><BR>This module is designed for 4-7 characters of first
through third levels. It includes a map of the village and a description
of its buildings and occupants, an overland journey to a challenging
underground adventure for especially brave (or foolhardy...) characters,
and a list of pre-rolled first level characters.</i>
