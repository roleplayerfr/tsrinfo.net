"A mutual friend has praised your skills highly. If you
seek rich reward and the oppurtunity to delve into mysteries ancient and
lost, bring this bottle forthwith to my demesne in the village of
Volkumburgh. Together we may seek to bring mankind the lost wonder of
the awtawmatawn."<BR><BR>A mysterious note, a disappearing 5-foot-long
religious artifact, and the ruins of two magical schools. What do these
things have in common? How deeply are your party members involved in
all of this?<BR><BR>"The Shattered Statue" is the first dual-game-system
module of its kind. Players of both the AD&D game system and DRAGONQUEST
game system can use this adventure. It is suitable for use with the
FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign setting.
