<b>The Map</b><BR>A few coppers buys this scrap of parchment bearing a
map on one side and the text in the box below on the other. The
lettering is done with a clear, steady hand. The peddler who offers it
makes no claims about its authenticity and values it strictly as a
curiousity.<BR>In any case, the name Didro Eightfingers (from the map
on the reverse of this sheet) is familiar to your character. Didro is
a luckless thief who has appeared in several short plays. Perhaps this
is merely an old theatrical handbill.<BR><BR><center><b>For use with
