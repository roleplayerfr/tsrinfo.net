Tired of your fighter doing nothing but trading swings with monsters?
Are your dungeon denizens' tactics getting a little too routine? Need
help setting up that siege of the evil overlord's castle? Then this is
the book for you. This exciting expansion to the AD&D game contains
rules and systems that will make your battles more vibrant and
realistic. There are new rules covering critical hits, tactical
options, and combat maneuvers such as shield walls, disarms, and more!
Complete weapons tables for all eras of play include lots of new
weapons and revised characteristics for old ones. The <i>Combat &
Tactics</i> system has been carefully designed to present sets of rules
in easy-to-use modules that you pick and choose from and incorporate
into your campaign. Regardless of which ones you do use, you'll find
everything works with everything else.<BR><BR><BR>
