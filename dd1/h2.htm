The most deadly dungeon ever devised! High-level
characters brave the unexplored corridors of Deepearth to confront
perhaps the most feared adversary in the AD&D game.<BR>The second chapter
of the Bloodstone Pass saga follows the conclusion of the desperate
war against the bandit army. A cold and bitter winter drives the
villagers to the edge of starvation, and numerous horrors strike the
town of Bloodstone Pass.<BR>Join the adventure as the heroes explore
the depths of the ancient bloostone mines, now inhabited by fearsome
demons. There they hope to uncover the fantastic treasures rumored to
exist in the unknown darkness. But deep within the mines, all is not
what it seems....<BR>This module uses the new rules from the <a href="dsg.htm"><i>
Dungeoneer's Survival Guide</i></a> and <a href="wsg.htm"><i>Wilderness
Survival Guide</i></a>. The adventure also includes optional <a href="bs.htm">
BATTLESYSTEM</a> scenarios fought entirely underground. These
supplementary products are not required to play the adventure, however.
