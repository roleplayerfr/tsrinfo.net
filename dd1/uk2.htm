Not even memories of past glory live on in the gentle hills around the
village of Kusnir. Today its people have more concern for commonplace
things, like the harvest, trade and the threat of death in the night!<BR>
Kusnir is beset by a skulk.<BR>The attentions of such a creature are a
curse on any community. Streets and alleys which ring to the voices of
children by day become fearful, shadowy places by night. Men go abroad
armed and in groups, while women and children stay behind locked doors
and even there are not safe. But life goes on. The lot of the peasant
is always hard, what cannot be prevented must be endured and, of course,
thing could be worse.<BR>Much worse. The skulk has begun to visit the
village more and more often. Sometimes it kills, yet just as often it
spares a victim, leaving clear signs of what it might have done had it
wished. Its visits are now marked by strange and illegible symbols
scrawled in blood on the walls of the buildings. The people are worried,
helpless and desperate. Desperate enough to welcome adventurers...
