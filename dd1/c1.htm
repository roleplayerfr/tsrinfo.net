<i>This module was originally used for the Official ADVANCED
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS tournament at Origins '79, and is the first in another
new series of modules from TSR, the COMPETITION SERIES. This module
contains a challenging setting as well as an original scoring system and
an assortment of pre-rolled characters for adventuring. The module may
thus be used for private competition among players, or as a seperate,
non-scored adventure! Also included herein are background information,
a large-scale referee's map, referee's notes, and new monsters and
descriptions for an added taste of excitement.<BR><BR>This module is meant
to stand on its own, and includes areas on the map where Dungeon Masters
may add their own levels.</i><BR><BR><a href="c1-alt.htm">Click here
