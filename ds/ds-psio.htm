<i>"Life-shapes are the wondrous tools of out ancient past. They are
our heritage, our birthright. Cast off the dead. Use not the unliving
tool. Out ancient glory can only be restored by embracing life, not
death."<BR><BR>We are all that is left. We hold in our hands the fate
of our people. The Rhul-thaun are the true fruit of the rhulisti tree.
The life-shapes are what set us above the other races. Only we still
know the secrets of life and how to shape it. Heed not the temptations
of the powers of the mind, for they are amathema. Spurn the lesser
races, for they are not of the true blood. Believe in the life-shapers,
for only they can deliver you to the glory that is our birthright."</i><BR><BR>
