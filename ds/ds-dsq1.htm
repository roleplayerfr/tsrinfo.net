<i>"Tyr is free! Tyr is free!" Such is the heady cry
that echoes from the darkest warrens to the gleaming chambers of the
Council in that ancient city. Now is your chance to savor life released
from the oppresive gloom of the sorceror-kings - but for how long?<BR>
New forces threaten the newly-born independence of Tyr, as outside forces
march upon the city. King Tithian is determined to resist, but there
are others on the Council of Advisors less eager to risk their wealth
and lives for the cause of independence. It falls upon you to help
mobilize and lead the citizen-army of Tyr on the road to Urik.<BR>
Designed for four to six characters of 4th to 7th level, <b>Road to Urik</b>
is set in and around Tyr, the campaign base for your DARK SUN game. A
stand-alone adventure, <b>Road to Urik</b> can also be played as the sequel to
<a href="ds-ds1.htm"><b>Freedom</b></a>.</i>
