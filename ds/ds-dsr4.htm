For thousands of years a great and terrible secret has
lain hidden in the depths of the Sea of Silt. In the heart of this vast
dust basin, an endless storm of ash and shrieking wind guards the deadliest
concentration of evil and power found on the dying world of Athas - the
Valley of Dust and Fire.<BR><BR><i>Valley of Dust and Fire</i> more than doubles
the known portions of the world of Athas. Intrepid explorers will
discover new wonders and perils within the deadly Sea of Silt, from the
beautiful island of Shault to the savage Mountains of the Sun. New rules
for traveling the dust basin and surviving its many dangers are included.<BR><BR>
With luck and determination, a skillful and well-prepared party just
might pass through the Great Ash Storm and enter the Valley of Dust and
Fire. But this realm of shattered badlands and awful monsters is so
deadly that only one man has ever reached the valley and returned to
tell the tale.
