Out of the swirling, bone-dry sands of Athas come hordes
of raiders. They overrun caravans, strip them bare, then vanish into
the untracked wastes once more. Who are these ghosts of the desert?
Where do they live? How do they survive far from the high walls of the
city-states? <i><b>Slave Tribes</b></i> answers these and many more questions about
the ex-slaves who escape into the desert.<BR>The DARK SUN game world is
now open to campaigns in realms beyond the reach of the sorceror-kings.
The most prominent and successful slave tribes of the Tyr region are
presented in great detail in this accessory. <i><b>Slave Tribes</b></i> enables the
DM to create entirely new tribes to roam his DARK SUN campaign. It also
shows players how to form their own tribes when their characters escape
the clutches of the sorceror-kings. The deadly world of Athas shows
no mercy to those who are unprepared for its dangers!
