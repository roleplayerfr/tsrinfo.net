The palace of the Forest Queen contains treasures
unimaginable. To the sons and daughters of Athas's harsher climes, Gulg
and the Crescent Forest seem almost perversely lush, a jumble of green
and growing things hording precious water for the benefit of the few.
But while basking in the glow of Lalali-Puy's gratitude, your characters
have the richness of the forest at your beck and call.<BR>Of course, the
Oba's sensibilities are easily bruised, and her nature is notoriously
unforgiviing. Gulg's dank dungeons are only a staging area to a deadly
ceremony, where the young nobles of the city chase prisoners through
the forest to earn their places as lord of their city - the Red Moon
Hunt.<BR>Designed for four to six characters of 7th to 10th level, <i>Asticlian
Gambit</i> makes them pawns in a dangerous game between the Oba of Gulg, the
Shadow King of Nibenay, and mysterious representatives of the Asticles
family of Tyr. A stand-alone adventure, <i>Asticlian Gambit</i> can also be
played as the sequel to <a href="ds-ds1.htm"><i>Freedom</i></a>, <a href="dsq1.htm"><i>Road to Urik</i></a>, and <a href="ds-dsq2.htm"><i>Arcane Shadows</i></a>.
