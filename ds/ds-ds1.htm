<i>Enter the ancient and corrupt city of Tyr, whose tyrannical
sorceror-king has ruled for a millennium. As you wander the city, from
the wreck of the elven warrens to the sanguine splendor of the arena,
you realize that the citizens of Tyr thirst less for water than they do
for freedom.<BR>Now, after a century of slave labor, sorceror king
Kalak's great ziggurat nears completion. He has promised the city a
grand celebration when the monument is done, complete with the most
brutal arena spectacle in Tyr's long history. Rumors abound as to the
nature of the spectacle: some believe it will bring with it the longed-for
manumission of countless slaves; others fear the annihilation of Tyr
and her people as a sacrifice to Kalak's hunger for power; and a secret
few believe it will be a day of revolution - a day of freedom!<BR>
Designed for four to seven players of starting levels, the <b>DM's Book</b> and
<b>Player's Book</b> inside this pack provide the DARK SUN game DMs with a
campaign base in Tyr, and give PCs a brutal introduction to Athas.
