In the deserts and cities of Athas, the most dangerous
weapon is the mind. With a thought, deadly mindbenders can shatter stone,
bend steel, or break opponents. Thousands of Athasians possess wild
psionic talents, but only a select few can master the Way and call
themselves psionicists.<BR><BR><i>The Will and the Way</i> provides more details on
psionics and psionicist characters. It introduces new character kits
and special psionicist proficiencies for the first time. It expands the
rules for psionic combat, adding a level of virtual reality to psychic
battles. With guidelines and examples it offers rules for creating new
psionic powers and crafting psionic items. Plus, it features over 60
new psionic powers for both wild talents and true psionicists.<BR><BR><i>The
Will and the Way</i> is not just for DARK SUN campaigns. As a companion
volume to <a href="../dd1/phbr5.htm"><i>The Complete Psionics Handbook</i></a>, the new powers and rules
expansions contained in this book can be used in any campaign. The Way
stretches before you. Do you have the Will to take the next step?
