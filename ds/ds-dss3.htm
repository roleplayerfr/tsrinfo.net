They run across the burning plains where others fear to
walk. They live for the moment, these savages of a dying world. The
elves of Athas are wild, dangerous, and unlike any other elves. Forget
the frail forest dwellers of other campaign worlds. Athas's elves
stand tall and lean, with long limbs and fearsome faces. They are thieves
and raiders, swift warriors and terrible foes.<BR><BR><i>Elves of Athas</i> explores
the passions that drive them, the abilities that make them different
from other races, and the outlook that lets them survive beneath the
crimson sun. This accessory uncludes savage encounters with the better
known tribes and an updated map of the Tablelands region. For players,
there are new rules for character creation and new Athasian elf kits -
offered to DARK SUN game characters for the first time.<BR><BR>The elves of
Athas are forged in the endless depths of the desert - burned dark by
the sun, toughened by the swirling sand, and given strength and swiftness
by the constant wind. Come run with them - if you dare!
