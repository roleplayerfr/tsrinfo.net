<center><i>When the brides of death become the marauders of Nibenay,<BR>
When the dead must die and the unsleeping must wake,<BR>Then the Dragon
shall be born anew.</i></center><BR><BR>For centuries the Veiled Alliance has been a
thorn in the side of the mighty sorceror-king Nibenay. Now the stars
are right and the mysterious Shadow King has decided to rid himself of
his unremitting rivals. But the Veiled Alliance is not easily defeated.
They too have been watching the stars, and they know that the history
of the great city has reached a crucial juncture. Both sides stand
ready for a great battle, but neither is prepared for the disaster that
looms over the city. By the time the sun rises again, the city will be
in ruins and the task of rebuilding it will fall squarely on the
shoulders of a small band of adventurers. The future is theirs to
decide, for good or evil.
