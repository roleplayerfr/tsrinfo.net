<i>Beyond the Scorched Plateau, across the Burning Plains, in the shadow
of the Thunder Mountains, the largest body of water beneath the crimson
sun sparkles like a desert mirage. But the place is real, for I have
seen it. I felt the cool spray on my skin, tasted the salt mist on my
lips. It is the Last Sea, a remnant of a long-lost age hidden far to
the north of Tyr....<BR></i>-From <i>The Wanderer's Journal</i><BR><BR>
The Last Sea, a huge body of cool water, remains locked in time, a
manisfestation of the Green Age that survives to the current Athasian
era. Here, people live in safety and peace - as long as they follow
the laws set forth by the ancient, immortal Mind Lords who rule over
them.<BR><BR>
<i>Mind Lords of the Last Sea</i> details the environs and
societies living in a hidden valley hundreds of miles north of the Tyr
Region. On the shores of the largest known body of water on Athas, the
ancient city of Saragar rises like a temple to the Green Age, and the
Triune Mind Lords hold sway over all with their powerful psionic abilities.<BR><BR>
This accessory is the second in a series of "Wanderer's Chronicles"
that explores the new areas of Athas. It features:<BR><BR>A 96-page sourcebook
that details the hidden valley, the Last Sea, and all the creatures and
intelligent races that inhabit the region - as well as a comprehensive
look at the Mind Lords and their great city, Saragar. This sourcebook
also includes new monsters, new rules, and new equipment specific to
this new region.<BR>A 32-page adventure book that provides a ready-to-play
adventure set in Saragar and around the Last Sea.<BR>A full-color, poster-sized
map of the Last Sea region complete with plenty of exciting new locations
to explore.<BR><BR>By the Last Sea, the danger is all in your mind....
