Few safe havens exist on Athas, and fewer still for
preservers. In the hidden places of the cities - a potter's shop, a
crematoria, even under the very palace of a sorceror-king - the Veiled
Alliance abides, aiding and protecting preservers and auxiliaries, and
standing against defilers. In Tyr, Balic, Draj, Gulg, Nibenay, Raam,
and Urik, protection from the dark forces of Athas endures.<BR><BR>Secret
recognition signals preserve their identities. For those seeking
membership comes a testing: after true intentions are proven, tests are
administered and, if failed, leads to a terrible death. If successful,
the candidate looks forward to years of perilous work and strife - the
results of which may never see the pages of a journal. And no one quits
the Alliance without facing <i>requital.<BR><BR>>Veiled Alliance</i> presents the
DM with all the information required to create Alliance-centered
campaigns on Athas - detailed information about the five aims, adventure
hooks for each Alliance, recognition signals, and maps of various
headquarters. All the features you need to create thrilling,
fundamental challenges to the Alliance on the ruthless world of Athas
are now revealed.
