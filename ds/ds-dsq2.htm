<i>Tyr has been freed, and the mighty army of Urik has
been turned back. These are new and strange times, indeed. Now Urik
has become home - at least for a while - and there are new markets to
shop, new streets to explore, and, oh yes, preservers to meet.<BR>
Preservers, the keepers of good magic, have sent a mysterious summons.
They are ready to embark on a new and dangerous plot to thwart sorceror-kings
and bring new life to Athas. To associate with preservers is dangerous
to say the least, but when the king's templars uncover the schemes, a
death mark falls upon all involved.<BR>Will a desperate journey across
the wastelands, with the templars in hot pursuit, end in victory or
chaos? The answers lie in the hearts of mighty heroes and the recesses
of Arcane Shadows.<BR>Designed for four to six characters of 5th to 8th
level, <b>Arcane Shadows</b> is set in Urik. A stand-alone adventure, <b>Arcane
Shadows</b> can aslo be played as the sequel to <a href="ds1.htm"><b>FreedomM</b></a> and <a href="../ad/ds-dsq1.htm"><b>Road to Urik</b></a>.</i>
