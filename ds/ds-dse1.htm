Hail heroes of Tyr!<BR><BR>Bravely you have served your
adopted city since the day of King Kalak's fall. As slaves and rebels
you rose from Kalak's slave pits to claim your freedom from his ancient
tyranny. Now that freedom is being threatened once again by an insidious
new enemy, one who controls the use of psionics throughout the dying
world of Athas!<BR><BR>The <i>Dragon's Crown</i> adventure is the exciting climax
in the <a href="ds-ds1.htm"><i>Freedom</i></a> flip-book module series. In one final journey of epic
proportions, the player characters must defend everything they have worked
so hard to build. Seven adventures connected by pne great plot take the
PCs from the volcanic islands of the Sea of Silt to an ancient wonder
hidden in the forests of the Dragon Crown Mountains. The grandest and
most ambitious adventure of the DARK SUN game world, <i>Dragon's Crown</i>
will provide many hours of exciting play!<BR><BR><i>Dragon's Crown</i> is suitable
for 4 to 6 characters of 10th to 13th levels. The previous flip-book
modules (<a href="ds-ds1.htm"><i>Freedom</i></a>, <a href="ds-dsq1.htm"><i>Road to Urik</i></a>, <a href="dsq2.htm"><i>Arcane Shadows</i></a>, and <a href="dsq3.htm"><i>Asticilian Gambit</i></a>)
