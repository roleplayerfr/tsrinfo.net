A simple trip from Urik to Raam: What could be easier?
But unexpected encounters and freakish sandstorms conspire to make this
journey more dangerous than imagined. Lost and dying of thirst, your
characters unwittingly involve themselves in a strange mission - the
motivation behind which lies hidden.<BR>On the adventurers' trail are
enraged dragons, desert fiends, and a curse that threatens to drive them
mad - or make them one of the walking dead. Their only hope is to enter
the ancient ruins of Yaramuke, site of a great battle between sorceror-kings
of ages past.<BR>Yaramuke...City of Black Waters. The very name curdles
blood.<BR>Designed for four to six characters of 3rd to 6th level, <i>Black
Flames</i> is set in and around the remains of Yaramuke and the cities of
Urik and Raam. Let your DARK SUN game characters experience new
adventure among the ancient ruins of Yaramuke!
