In the city of Balic, an insidious new threat to the
Tyr region has arisen in the shape of a humble beetle. Magically altered
to deliver a psionic malady via their bite, the beetles have been used
by templars, slavers, raiders, and worse to neutralize the psionic
abilities of their captives and render them docile. In desperation, the
Veiled Alliance has called upon your characters to track down the source
of the sinister beetles and put an end to them. There's only one problem -
the most powerful merchant house of the Tyr region is growing even
wealthier from the parasitic trade!<BR><BR><i>Merchant House of Amketch</i> is
designed for four to six characters of 4th to 7th levels. Explore the
trade routes and intrigues south of the Estuary of the Forked Tongue, in
the heart of the Tyr region! <i>Merchant House of Amketch</i> can be played
as a stand alone adventure or as the sequel to <a href="ds-dsm1.htm"><i>Black Flames</i></a>.
