<i>Most adventurers know better than to listen to rumors.
But when rumors spreak of a magical forest blooming deep in the burning
stretch of the Alluvial Sand Wastes, even the most battle-hardened
gladiator takes notice. A mysterious summons has gone out to the humans
and demihumans of the Tyr region, luring them to the new forest and
promising Athas's salvation. Now your characters have heard the call -
but will they heed the Forest Maker, ot seek to destroy her?</i><BR><BR>Designed
for four to six characters of 11th to 13th level, <i>Forest Maker</i> brings
player characters from the sun-baked streets of Tyr to the walled
fortress of Altaruk and beyond. <i>Forest Maker</i> is a stand-alone adventure.<BR><BR>
This latest in the DARK SUN series of adventures has been redesigned
with standard-size booklets, one for the DUNGEON MASTER and one for the
players. A third booklet provides a descriptive short story to set the
tone of your adventure.
