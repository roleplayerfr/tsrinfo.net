In the harsh lands of Athas, even the bare necessities
of life are hard to come by. The caravans of the traders ply the shifting
sands, daring raiders and the elements to bring goods and hope to both
the teeming hordes of the city-states and the isolated villagers in the
trackless wastelands. Without the traders, life on Athas would be
impossible.<BR><i>Dune Trader</i> explores the lives of the people who are the
lifeblood of Athas. The major merchant houses of the Tyr region are
described, as well as minor houses, elven merchant and raiding tribes,
and the mercantile tendencies of all the races of Athas. The personalities
who drive these houses and tribes are detailed fully within these pages.<BR>
A new character class is introduced here - the trader class. The DM
receives complete instructions on how to run a trader-based campaign,
and the players are shown how to play trader characters and start their
own merchant houses. The most vital and exciting challenges on Athas
await within this book!
