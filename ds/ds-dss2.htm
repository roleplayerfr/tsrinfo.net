On a world with no gods, what do priests serve? The
priest class on Athas is unique and distinct from the priest classes of
any other AD&D world. Athasian priests worship no gods, collect no
followers, and carry edged weapons.<BR><BR><i>Earth, Air, Fire, and Water</i> answers
all your questions about this singular class of clerics. Here are the
elemental priests who serve the elementals and Athas. They strive to
return their barren and battered world to its former state of lush green
valleys, forested mountains, and cool waterfalls.<BR><BR>Here are the
paraelemental priests who oppose the restoration of Athas, serving the
paraelements whose power and might is growing as defiler magic continues
to plunge Athas further into decay and ruin.<BR><BR>New priest kits allow
PCs to become an Athasian elemental priest of Earth, of Air, of Fire, or
of Water - but they can only serve one, for the elements are jealous
masters. Each kit contains unique powers, limitations, and proficiencies.
Each offers four different ways in which to bring about the regeneration
of Athas: as a Wanderer, as a Guardian of a shrine, as a City Cleric, or
as a Shaman of a tribe. But beware the paraelemental priests - their
success depends upon the failure of the elemental clerics!
