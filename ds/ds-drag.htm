<b>EXPLORE THE 10TH LEVEL OF MAGIC.</B><BR>Only the most powerful
characters are destined to rule Athas. Warriors with vast armies of
followers campaign for glory; rogues become masters of illusory magic
to further their deadly schemes; spellcasters who can also master psionics
open whole new tomes of magic available to them - the most powerful spells
ever! And not only do they gain greater magic, the spellcasters take
on entirely new forms when they advance beyond 20th level - clerics can
attain elemental form; preservers mutate into magnificent avangions;
defilers can actually transform into dragons themselves! Learn of
these advanced beings, the new magical spells available to them, plus
new psionic devotions and organizations, military vehicles and army
lists, and more, all within the pages of Dragon Kings!
