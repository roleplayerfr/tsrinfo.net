<i>Reviled and hunted, hated and feared, they live in secrecy, hiding
who and what they are from the rest of the world. They are criminals
whose crime calls for swift execution. They are outcasts, with no place
to call home. They are wizards, and their crime is the practice of
magic....</i><BR><BR>Beneath the crimson sun, the life of a wizard is
hard and dangerous. Blamed for the conditions of the world, feared for
the mysterious power they wield, and hated for crimes both real and
imagined, Athasian wizards walk in the shadows of civilization and in
the barren wastes of the wilderness. For to reveal their nature is to
admit their crime - and risk their very lives.<BR><BR>
<i>Defilers and Preservers: The Wizards of Athas</i> details
the two paths of magic in the DARK SUN campaign and the strange way
magic works there. It demonstrates how Athasian wizards power their
magic and describes both types of wizards - defilers and preservers.<BR><BR>
Defilers leech energy from the land, stealing life away with every spell
they cast and leaving only dead ash behind. Preservers also gather
energy from the land, but they take only what they need and work to keep
the world healthy and alive. These two mortal enemies stand locked in
a never-ending battle - with the survival of Athas at stake.<BR><BR>This
accessory presents everything needed to create and play prserver and
defiler wizards. It features:<BR><BR>A discussion on Athasian magic - how
it works, who can use it and what it can do.<BR>New rules for Athasian
wizards.<BR>New proficiencies and plenty of wizard character kits.<BR>Rules
for the advanced beings - dragons and avangions.<BR>Information on three
new types of defilers and preservers - ceruleans, necromancers, and
shadow wizards.<BR>Details on the mysterious planes known as the Black
and the Gray.<BR><BR>Which path of magic will you choose?
