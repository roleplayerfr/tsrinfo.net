They tower above mere human warriors and adventurers.
In a savage world, they hunt - and all else is prey. Wandering the sandy
wastes and stony barrens under the crimson sun, thri-kreen are the most
skilled trackers, the most barbaric gladiators, the most implacable of
foes. Mysterious and savage, the mantis people have been a closed book.
<i>Until now...<BR><BR>Thri-Kreen of Athas</i> enters the world of the nomadic
thri-kreen - a world governed by <i>tokchak</i>, the clutchmind, and <i>tikchak</i>,
the hunt-mind. From hatching to hunting to coming of age, the secrets
of the thri-kreen are at last revealed. From their formidable combat
abilities to the subtleties of their psionic powers, this accessory
explores every aspect of thri-kreen life. For players, there are new
rules and new character kits - offered to DARK SUN game characters for
the first time!<BR><BR>A special adventure for thri-kreen characters, <i>The
Taste of Fear</i>, is included. Dire events in the unknown North trigger
ancient racial memories. What terrors lie in the lost secrets of their
past?
