Unknown to even the mightiest of sorceror-kings, a fire
is stirring deep beneath the barren soil of Athas. Sheltered by the
titanic bulk of the Black Spine mountains, a terrible force has ripped
open the very fabric of time and space. Now a shimmering portal stands
open and a long-forgotten enemy assembles its sinister forces to invade
the kingdoms under the dark sun.<BR><BR>The only thing that stands in the
way of this terrible fate is a band of heroes. Assembled from the four
corners of this tortured world and bound together by the tangled cords
of fate, they must face an enemy the likes of which they have never seen
before. The odds are against them, but they dare not fail. The fate of
the world is in their hands.<BR><BR><i>Black Spine</i> is an adventure for 4 to 6
characters of 10th through 13th level. The previous flip-book modules
(<a href="ds-dsm1.htm"><i>Black Flames</i></a>, <a href="dsm2.htm"><i>Merchant House of Amketch</i></a>, and <a href="dsm3.htm"><i>Marauders of Nibenay</i></a>)
precede this adventure, but they are not necessary to enjoy <i>Black Spine</i>.
