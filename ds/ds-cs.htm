<i>Amid the barren wastelands of Athas lies the scattered
city states, each in the grip of its own, tyrannical sorceror-king.
Protecting their own positions with dark magic, they demand absolute
obedience. The restless mobs are placated with bread and circuses - the
arenas overflow with spectators seeking release from their harsh lives.<BR>
The land outside the cities belongs to no one. Savage elves race across
the deserts while insectoid thri-kreen satisfy their taste for blood.
Dwarves labor at projects beyond the scope of men, and feral halflings
lie in ambush.<BR>Athas is a land of deadly magic and powerful psionics
that offers no promise of glory or even of survival. Those who do not
have the cunning to face life on Athas will surely perish - leaving
nothing but bones bleached white under the blistering rays of the Dark Sun.</i><BR><BR>
