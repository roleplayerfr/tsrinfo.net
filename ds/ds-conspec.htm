<center><u>From the Designer</u><BR><BR>"The DARK SUN campaign world
enters an exciting new age with the release of the <a href="ds-cs2.htm">
Expanded and Revised Campaign Setting</a> for Athas, a land of savage
adventure where the most powerful AD&D player characters battle to
survive and prosper against overwhelming odds. It's a dynamic world of
unfolding stories and ancient myteries, full of explosive new role-playing
challenges and brutal action. From its volatile political atmosphere
to unyielding natural disasters, from terrible new villains to
unexpected new allies, from vast stretches of unexplored territory
beyond the Tyr region to unparalled oppurtunities to forge a more
promising future for the world, never has the DARK SUN setting been
more spectacular or thrilling for loyal players - or more accessible to
new players daring enough to enter the burning land. With new areas to
explore. a streamlined, complete-in-the-box psionics system, new rules,
and more, Dark Sun continues to demonstrate its alien and fierce
nature. Open the box and see why adventures set beneath the crimson
sun are different from those in any other AD&D setting. And watch
upcoming products for revelations that point toward Athas's ultimate
restoration - or its ultimate destruction. Now, more than ever, the
fate of the world depends on the actions of its heroes."</center>
