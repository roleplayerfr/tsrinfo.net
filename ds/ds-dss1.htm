Tyr has battled and bled for its freedom, throwing off
the yokes of an insane sorceror-king and slavery. The city stands poised
on the brink of democracy. but has Tyr the strength to seize the future
and shape it in the image of that freedom, or has the city merely traded
one form of slavery for another?<BR><BR><i>City-State of Tyr</i> addresses these
matters and more. Within this 96-page booklet is the most complete,
detailed description of Tyr's peoples, places, and plots ever. The
premier city of the DARK SUN campaign setting now lies complete for an
Athasian campaign's player characters. Learn the city's history, attend
a Council meeting, wander the city's business districts, and explore
the mysterious Under Tyr - the ancient ruins of the forgotten city upon
which Tyr was built.
