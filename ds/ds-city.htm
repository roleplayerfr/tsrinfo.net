<i>Something awakens beneath the ruins of ancient Giustenal, the City by
the Silt Sea. Many have tried to discover the secrets of this forsaken
place, to plunder its legendary treasures. Few have returned from its
shadowy embrace. Did they run afoul of savage raiders in the desert
wastes? Did they lose their way in a sudden sandstorm only to sink
hopelessly into the blowing, shifting silt? Perhaps they heard the
psionic voice of the Caller in Darkness and succumbed to its mesmerizing
summons? Or did they meet the true master of the ruins, a being as old
as the Dragon - and just as terrifying?...
<BR><BR>The burning world has reached a critical stage. For
Athas, it could mean the start of a time of renewal, or it could herald
the end of the world! It all begins in the ruins of Giustenal, in a place
from another age, in the corpse of a shattered, long-dead city. Something
stirs in the City by the Silt Sea. Something evil...</i><BR><BR><b><i>City by the Silt
