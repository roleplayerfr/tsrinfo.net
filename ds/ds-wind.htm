And so I found myself learning about a folk that I had never heard
described even in rumors. These halflings are an ancient people - in
fact, they gave me a new definition for "ancient." Their race is older
than any other on Athas. They remember times before the Warbringer,
before magic, and before the advent of the Way."<BR>-The Wanderer's
Journal<BR><BR>
To the west of Tyr, the proud strongholds of the Jagged
Cliffs defy everything that is known about Athas. The history of the
halflings who live there is as old as Athas itself. Their origins lie
with the rhulisti, who were masters of the world during the Blue Age -
and who caused the end of an age when a simple experiment went horribly
awry.<BR><BR><i>Winderiders of the Jagged Cliffs</i> details the lives of the rhul-thaun -
the descendants of the rhulisti and the keepers of ancient knowledge who
practice the most unusual and arcane art under the crimson sun: the shaping
of life itself.<BR><BR>This 128-page accessory for players and Dungeon Masters
alike is the first in the "Wanderer's Chronicle" series that explores
new areas of Athas. It features:<BR><BR>Details of the Jagged Cliffs region,
the rugged land that lies between Tyr and the Kreen Empire.<BR><BR>Living
tools left from Athas's dim past, including organic weapons, armor, and
flying vehicles.<BR><BR>Secrets of the swamp at the base of the Cliffs, and
its link to all magic within the world of Athas.<BR><BR>Details for creating
these unique halfling characters, and rules for making and using living
weapons.<BR><BR>A complete adventure for existing PCs or newly created
rhul-thaun characters.
