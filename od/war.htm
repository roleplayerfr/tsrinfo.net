<i>On a rugged island filled wit unnatural dangers, fierce and proud
barbarians must fight for their lives.</i><BR><BR>The barbarians who
call themselves the Knorr, driven from their homeland, wanted nothing
but freedom and an honorable existence when they landed on the shores
of Jakandor. What they found was an island occupied by despicable
wielders of vile magic - the Broken People, as the Knorr call them, who
rely on legions of animated corpses to do their fighting. These enemies
represent everything the Knorr find hateful and dishonorable, and no
clansman will rest until the last of the Broken People has tasted
Knorrman steel.<BR><BR>A new, self-contained campaign arena conceived
by Jeff Grubb, the ODYSSEY setting can be placed within any ADVANCED
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS world. New barbarian character kits, new forms of
magic, and the oppurtunity for new styles of role-playing make <i>
Jakandor: Island of War</i> a fresh experience for all players, novices
and veterans alike.
