<i>Centuries ago, a magical plague swept across the island of Jakandor
and struck down the majestic Charonti civilization. A Golden Age of
learning, art, and magic was lost in a period of days as the magically
based culture that the wise and Charonti people had developed collapsed
around them.</i><BR><BR>The few Charonti who survived learned to adapt
to the new world; the wizards mastered necromantic arts that allowed
the fallen victims of the plague to continue to serve the new Charonti
culture as a manual labor force. After a period of vicious civil war,
the nation has now united under a fair and benevolent queen. The
Charonti people seek to regain their lost magic and their lost empire -
but as they explore the island seeking ancient cities that have been
swallowed by the wilderness, they find that their ancestral home has
been invaded.<BR><BR>In this, the second of the three-part <i>Jakandor</i>
series of products, the history, culture, politics, religion, cities,
attitudes, and magic of the Charonti people - a nation of wizards -
is fully detailed for the first time. Included in this package is all
the information needed to run Charonti PCs in a full-fledged Jakandor
campaign, including a color map of Jakandor. The Charonti's unique
magic system is also detailed with new kits and new spells for
Charonti PC wizards.
