<b>THE EBERRON DM's BEST FRIEND</b><BR><BR>Behind this sturdy four-panel
screen, you control your Eberron campaign. This invaluable game aid helps
you conceal notes, miniatures, and other surprises from your player's eyes.
The landscape format makes it easier for you to see the game in front of
your screen while maximizing the space you have behind it. In addition to
providing useful tables from the <a href="../3e/phb35.htm"><i>Player's
Handbook</i></a> and <a href="../3e/dmg35.htm"><i>Dungeon Master's
Guide</i></a>, this deluxe screen provides information of particular
interest to Eberron DMs, including a list of dragonmarked houses and
guilds and an Eberron calendar.<BR><BR>This product also includes a
detailed poster map of the continent of Khorvaire, the point of origin
for most Eberron campaigns. This comprehensive and richly detailed poster
map includes political borders, settlements, roads, lightning rail routes,
and never-before-seen sites for adventurers to explore.
