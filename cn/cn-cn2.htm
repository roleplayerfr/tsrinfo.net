Fair fortune or foul brought you and your companions to the Barony of
Aldoc, infamous for its bloody persecution of mages and the priesthood
of any pantheon. But where there's strife there are those willing to
hire a band of mercenaries such as yours. Indeed, fate seemed to smile
the first week, for the Baron himself sought your services to recover a
bauble, a royal symbol stolen by some lackwit.<BR><BR>But fate played
strange games when the trail led to an underground labyrinth. Now you
scrabble through slimy caves, stalked by a band of mysterious masked
men, unsure if you will ever again see the light of day.<BR><BR>But if
any man can succeed, it is the captain of your company. He earned his
sword in the frozen wastelands of the north against barbarian and
soldier alike. He's one man you'd follow into the netherworld itself,
this man called Conan!
