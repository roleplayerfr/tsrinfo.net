"Strange cries I've heard over the walls at the Royal Palace at night.
Demons is practiced, mark me. The king's tried everything else. Now
he's turning to the powers of the night," whispered the bent and
wrinkled old man. "We're all doomed, we are."<BR><BR>The king of Ophir
is dying. He refuses to name an heir, believing he will be cured. His
nobles are sure no cure will be found and that the country will soon be
left without king or heir. The nobles are amassing private armies,
plotting for the throne, while the king's army hides. Bandits now raid
freely, and the Ophireans are refugees within their own land, fleeing
to the safety of the cities.<BR><BR>It is through this land you, Conan
and your company of mercenaries, journey. For there are reports of
good work for any who can swing a sword or cut a purse. In this
troubled land, however, the trick is to avoid having your own throat or
purse cut...<BR><BR>Journey through this land of chaos and confusion
based on the CONAN THE TRIUMPHANT book by Robert Jordan.
