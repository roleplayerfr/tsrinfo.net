"His name is Conan, and no man can stand before him in battle."<BR><i>
"Conan the Conqueror"<BR>by Robert E. Howard</i><BR><BR>In an age long
ago, there existed a hero - Conan. With fiery will, he slashed his
name across the ancient lands of Hyboria.<BR><BR>It was a time when
bravery, trickery, and magic decided men's fates, and a steel sword
could make the difference between life and death. For the daring,
strong, and clever, there were fortunes to find and lands to rule.<BR><BR>
Travel back to this with Conan and his companions, Juma, Valeria, and
Nestor. Travel back to defeat the dark horrors of his land!
