<center>This is the first Gazetteer to outline a non-human culture:
that of the Elves. Herein DMs and players alike will find information
on elven society, politics, economics, and culture. Fascinating,
first-hand details on the fabulous tree-cities are at last available to
adventurers. The pageant of elven life hinted at in such previous TSR
products as <a href="../dd/dd-cm7.htm">CM7, The Tree of Life</a>,
is now revealed in its entirety. For players of elven characters, this
is an invaluable resource. Portions of the elven way of life that were
cloudy until recently are outlined here in crystal clarity. The same
material will be of aid to the DM who uses Alfheim in his or her
campaign. <i>The Elves of Alfheim</i> is sure to become a staple of
any D&D game campaign.</center></td></tr><tr><td><BR></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFDDAA">
