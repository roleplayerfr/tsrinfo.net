<center><i>"He who has the gold makes the rules."</i><BR><BR>An old
Darokinian saying.<BR><BR>In Darokin, wealth is power. There is no
place in this land for the unthinking brute who solves every problem
with force. Darokin has survived by cleverness, by negotiation, and
by guile, despite being surrounded by mighty barbarous nations.<BR><BR>
In fact, the Darokinians have thrived over the years, establishing
themselves as the undisputed masters of overland commerce. And, since
dead neighbors make poor trading partners, they've become equally
adept at diplomacy.<BR><BR><i>The Republic of Darokin</i>, the latest
Gazetteer for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game system, gives you an in-depth
look at this prosperous land, including:</center><BR><ul><li>A new
Merchant character class<li>A complete, detailed history of Darokin
<li>The geography, government, peoples, society, and cities of this

full-color map of the Republic of Darokin<li>Two full-color sheets of
cardboard fold-ups - build your own merchant caravans in 3D</ul><center>
