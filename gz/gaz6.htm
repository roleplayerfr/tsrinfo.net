Dwarves have a reputation that is both good and bad. On the good side,
they are known as loyal, hard-working, dependable, and fierce defenders
of their homes. On the other side, they are condsidered...well, a
little dull.<BR>No longer. The Dwarves of Rockhome, the latest
Gazetteer for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS games system, gives you a complete,
in-depth look at a vibrant, living, anything-but-dull society. Included
is information on the history, government, economy, and geography of
Rockhome, as well as entries on the major cities and towns, and
biographies on dozens of important figures. For the first time, learn
the truth about dwarven magic-users, clerics, and religions! And like
the other Gazetteers, the Dwarves of Rockhome not only includes complete
adventures, but background information for home-hewn plots. And of
course, there are the high-quality, detailed four-color maps you've
come to expect. The Dwarves of Rockhome is the sixth in this popular
series, providing a rich tapestry of background material for player
and DM alike.
