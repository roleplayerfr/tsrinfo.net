<center>Ethengar is a vast grassy plain, offering little protection
from either the bitter winds of winter or the blistering sun of
summer. This rough land tests the people who live on it every day,
and those who survive that test grow strong and hardy. It is a land
of warrior horsemen, as fierce and deadly as they are skilled.<BR><BR>
Once a multitude of warring tribes, the people of Ethengar have united
under a single leader, the Golden Khan. Learn more about him and his
land in <i>The Golden Khan of Ethengar</i>, the twelfth in a series of
