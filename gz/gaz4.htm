To some, it is a vacationer's paradise. Tropical islands, set in sapphire
seas, fringed with shell-covered beaches: the perfect spot to "get away
from it all." To others, it is a place to be feared. Pirates'
hideaways, disease-ridden jungles, psychotic natives: the perfect spot
to avoid.<BR>The Kingdom of Ierendi comprises ten islands, each with a
specific attraction for the adventure-seeking visitor. The native
population includes the Makai, the original tribe to inhabit the islands,
and various settlers who have chosen these exotic locales as their
home (well for some, perhaps "chosen" isn't quite the proper word...).<BR>
Your characters want to take a break from continental life? Here is the
material for precisely that kind of relief. This Gazetteer includes
information on each island in the Kingdom, complete maps of the area,
adventures keyed to specific locations (as well as some more general
ones), and for the DM a new method of playing out sea battles, complete
with ship counters. Come back to Ierendi. Make it yours, again and
again.
