From the ashes of an ancient culture of proud warriors rises a race of
people unlike any other in the Known World.<BR><BR>Long ago, the power
of Blackmoor all but destroyed the mighty Azcans. Some of them, the
bravest of the brave, sought refuge under the shadow of a great plateau.
For decades, they struggled to preserve their lives and their culture.
Now, centuries later, their secrets are revealed. From the buffalo
