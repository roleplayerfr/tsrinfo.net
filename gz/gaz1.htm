This is the first in a series - a completely new concept in gaming aids
for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game system. Within these covers is a
complete historical, economical, geographical, and sociological overview
of the Grand Duchy of Karameikos. Entries on (and maps of) the major
cities and towns, as well and biographical entries on the important
figures in the Duchy, will aid the DM in preparing his own adventures
as well as enrich the playing of published adventures.<BR><BR>In addition,
there is a full-size, four-color map showing not only Karameikos itself,
but also the capital city of Specularum, the city of Kelvin, and the
town of Threshold. This map will be fully compatible with those to
follow in the series, so that DMs and players can put them side by side
for comparison and/or play.<BR><BR>Beginning with the Grand Duchy of
Karameikos, this series provides a rich tapestry of background material
for player and DM alike, sure to benefit the gamer immeasurably.
