This is the second in a series - a completely new concept in gaming aids
for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game system. Within these covers is a
complete historical, economical, geographical, and sociological overview
of the Emirates of Ylaruam. The village of Kirkuk is presented in
great detail (with both descriptions and a map of the area) as a
typical village in the Emirates. An extended section on campaigning in
the Emirates will also aid the DM in preparing his own adventures as
well as enrich the playing of published adventures.<BR><BR>In addition,
there is a full-size, color map of the Emirates, the cities of
Surra-Man-Raa and Tameronikas, a typical Emirates village, and a
caravan village. This map is fully compatible with all Gazetteers in
this series, so that DMs and players can put them side by side for
comparison and/or play.<BR><BR>This series of Gazetteers provides a
rich tapestry of background material for player and DM alike and is
sure to benefit the gamer immeasurably.
