While Maeshi province revels in the festival spirit, clouds gather
over the political scene. Two warlords are vying for control of this
otherwise peaceful place, and you are guests of one of them. Sun
Temple officials have offered complete support to the faction which
successfully travels to Ito-jo Castle (said to hold relics of great
importance to the Sun Temple), brings them back safely, and returns
them to the Inn of the Globefish.<BR>The plan is laid before you. You
are to leave immediately under secrecy for the castle of the Ito clan,
also known as the Seven Swords clan. Find the relics, and return them
to the renowned inn Doi no Fugu. Extreme caution is needed here, for
your warlord's rival must not hear of this!<BR>Is the castle really
haunted? What lies in the caverns beneath it? Will Korimori's
troops discover your plan and try to wrest the relics from you, should
you even get that far? What will you find at the Inn of the Globefish?<BR>
Come, honorable stranger - the Seven Swords await!
