<center><b>The nightmare of Acererak's tomb<BR>once again hungers for life!</b></center><BR>
Imagine a place of unspeakable evil. It was built upon hopelessness
and filled with unending terror and pain. This loathsome place shattered
the life of everyone who ventured near. But through tremendous
sacrifice and heroism, over the course of many years, it was finally
gutted and its foul creator destroyed.<BR><BR>Now imagine that the
horror is beginning all over again.<BR><BR>The sinister wizard Acererak
took great pains to safeguard his tomb. It took many years, and many
more lives, before his evil was finally laid to rest. But though the
demilich is gone, he is not forgotten. Others who would become as he
was have traveled to the site of Acererak's tomb seeking the secrets of
mastery of death. Slowly these pilgrims gathered, eventually building
in the shadow of the tomb itself a community dedicated to the dark
arts: Skull City.<BR><BR>But even these twisted necromancers have no
inkling of the true evil that swells and crackles beneath their feet.<BR><BR>
