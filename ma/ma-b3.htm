Deep below the surface lies an ancient beholder city called Ilth
K'hinax. In times past, hundreds of beholders called it home - until
simmering rivalries within their society exploded into warfare. The
few survivors fled, leaving the city deserted for hundreds of years.
However, the story of Ilth K'hinax's glory was passed down from one
generation of beholders to the next. Now, after countless years of
self-imposed exile, the beholders are back!<BR><BR>After securing the
city, the hive mother of Ilth K'hinax implemented a plan to wipe out
all the beings living above it. Unfortunately for the beholders,
several facets of the hive mother's plan have been revealed through the
exploits of a part of adventurers. Now, this group of heroes must meet
eye to eye with Ilth K'hinax's newest occupants in an effort to stop
the hive mother's pernicious plan!<BR><BR><i>Eye to Eye</i> is the
last of three adventures featuring the nightmarish beholder. It can
be played as an individual mission or as part of the series that began
with <a href="ma-b1.htm"><i>Eye of Pain</i></a> and
continued in <a href="ma-b2.htm"><i>Eye of Doom</i></a>.
