After hiring a group of brave adventures to help him "acquire" a
beholder specimen, the mage Velinax disappears! Rumors blame an
insidious thieves' guild called the Unblinking Eye for this turn of
events. Why would the Unblinking Eye wish to "take care" of the mage?
Why does the guild want to speak to anyone involved with Welinax?
Finally, what dark goal does the guild truly intend to accomplish?
Finding out the answers to these questions will leady doughty adventurers
straight through the shadows of a crafty thieves' guild and onto the
threshold of an even deeper and more dangerous darkness.<BR><BR><i>Eye
of Doom</i> is the second of three adventures featuring the nightmarish
