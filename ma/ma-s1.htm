<center>YOU SHOULD BE AFRAID OF THE WATER...</center><BR>When the sun
sinks low, the sea devils rise dripping from the dark waves. They
swarm like sharks, lethal and unstoppable. Death glints like a promise
in their rabid eyes, and the blood of their prey paints their claws and
teeth scarlet.<BR>Night after night they come, slaying all who stand
in their way. Their sudden raids have devastated the island, bringing
fishing and commerce to a halt as the people cower in their homes,
dreading the next sunset. Desperate, the Potentate of Angleburg has
sent for help from daring adventurers willing to face the devil men of
the deep. But more secrets lurk beneath the waves: this is no passing
attack but part of a more sinister, secret design by the most
dangerous and capable race to inhabit the dark seas.<BR>Evil Tide is
the first of an adventure trilogy (continuing with <a href="ma-s2.htm"><i>
Night of the Shark</i></a> and concluding in <a href="ma-s3.htm"><i>
Sea of Blood</i></a>) that pits brave adventurers against the evil
race called "sahuagin" by the air-breathing races. The sahuagin
adventure trilogy can be played seperately or linked together to form
a seamless epic-length adventure. The sahuagin trilogy supports <a href="ma-devils.htm"><i>
Sea Devils</i></a>, a MONSTROUS ARCANA source book providing invaluable,
fascinating, and immediately applicable supplementary information.
