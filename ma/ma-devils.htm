<center>EVIL DENIZENS OF THE DEPTHS: THE SAHUAGIN.</center><BR>The
sahuagin are known by many names. Some call them the Devil Men of the
Deep; to others they are simply <i>the Sea Devils</i>. This deadly
race of aquatic beings has remained a mystery to surfacedwellers -
until now. This fully illustrated 96-page accessory details the
highly organized structure of sahuagin society, offers insight into the
workings of the predatory sahuagin mind, and examines the worship of
Sekolah, the dark Sahuagin deity. <i>The Sea Devils</i> also includes
a full description of a typical sahuagin village easily usable in any
campaign setting, new spells that are granted to sahuagin priestesses,
and a color poster detailing the sahuagin in all their variety.<BR>This
book is the second in a series of accessories that focuses on some of
the most popular monsters in the AD&D game. DMs and players alike
should also look for <a href="ma-s1.htm"><i>Evil Tide</i></a>,
<a href="ma-s2.htm"><i>Night of the Shark</i></a> and
<a href="ma-s3.htm"><i>Sea of Blood</i></a>, a trilogy of
MONSTROUS ARCANA adventures centered around the sahuagin.
