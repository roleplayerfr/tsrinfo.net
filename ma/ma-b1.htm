Inside the woods near Burke's Crossing lurks a very real danger. It
began as a sense of unease, a feeling of being watched. But now people
are disappearing. The lumberjacks who have stayed in the little
village talk of ghosts and other superstitions. Or at least they did -
until a mysterious statue appeared in a clearing near the logging camp.<BR><BR>
As if matters weren't strange enough, two mages have arrived and begun
hiring armed guards to escort them into these very same woods. Is
there a connection, or is it just coincidence? Either way, be prepared!
You never know what's out there waiting...and watching.<BR><BR><i>Eye
of Pain</i> is the first of three MONSTROUS ARCANA <i>adventures
featuring the cunning and deadly beholder. It can be played as an
individual adventure or as part of the series which continues in <a href="ma-b2.htm">
Eye of Doom</a> and concludes in <a href="ma-b3.htm">Eye
to Eye</a>.
