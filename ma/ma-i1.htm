"Put out the Sun; Darken the Light!" -Illithid aphorism<BR><BR><i>I
watched the early morning sun dribble above the horizon, only to have
my worst fears realized. As I looked on, something vast and unseen
took a monstrous bite out of the sun, leaving gaping teeth marks. The
bloated red disc guttered and spit, finally plunging back below the
horizon like a wounded bird in flight, dousing the plain in stygian
darkness.... And I knew what I had long suspected: They had returned!</i><BR><BR>
Something is very wrong in Stormport: Corruption runs rampant among
city officials, more and more people turn up missing every day, dark
prophesies of Change convert new believers, and rumors persist of
a demonic beast with a taste for human flesh that stalks the alleyways.
Worse yet, spring is overdue; winter refuses to relinquish its icy
grip.<BR><BR>Only one vile force could cause such chaos: The Illithids
have risen up once again, ready to enslave the surface races. Now, as
never before, the world needs great heroes, mighty adventurers who will
challenge the illithids' dark agendas.<BR><BR><i>A Darkness Gathering</i>
is the first of an adventure trilogy (continuing with <a href="ma-i2.htm"><i>
Masters of Eternal Night</i></a> and concluding in <a href="ma-i3.htm"><i>
Dawn of the Overmind</i></a>) that pits brave adventurers against the
brain-eating mind flayers. Dungeon Masters can run each individual
adventure of the trilogy seperately, or they can be linked together to
form a seamless, epic-length adventure.<BR><BR>The illithid trilogy
supports <a href="ma-i.htm"><i>The Illithiad</i></a>, a
MONSTROUS ARCANA supplement that provides invaluable supplementary
information on mind flayers and their evil plans.
