<center>"WHEN THE STORM COMES IN WITH ITS TEETH, TEETH, TEETH..."</center><BR>
Black clouds build on the horizon with supernatural swiftness as the
light of day drains away like a guttering candle. As the wind screams
and sea spray blinds the eyes, the masts splinter and the decks heels
over, a plaything of the storm. A nightmare shark hunts the murky
ocean for all that succumb to the hammer of the winds. Can anyone
survive the Tempest of the Deep Mother?<BR><BR><i>Night of the Shark</i>
is the second part of an adventure trilogy featuring the evil sahuagin,
deadly sea devils in pursuit of an ancient relic known as The Stone
Which Abides. This adventure can be played independently, or it can
be linked together as part of the adventure series that began with <a href="ma-s1.htm"><i>
Evil Tide</i></a> and concludes with <a href="ma-s3.htm"><i>
Sea of Blood</i></a>.
