A new age dawns...an age of terror!<BR><BR><i>They are close. I can
feel them even stronger, now. It won't be long before the Masters
come again. I have waited for them, waited for their return. Once
they extinguish the Light, the true Dawn can begin.</i><BR><BR>The
illithids once ruled a mighty empire that strecthed across many worlds.
These foul creatures enslaved or destroyed whole races in their quest
for ultimate power - until a rebellion spread like fire on dry plains.
The mind flayer empire toppled, and the multiverse was freed from
eternal servitude.<BR><BR>Now, a hundred suns burn toward extinction,
their light stolen by the flayers to reinvent the past. If the PCs do
not stop the new dawn, the Dawn of the Overmind, the illithids will
rule once again! Following the clues left by their benefactor, the
adventurers journey over a vast world of ancient ruins. Buried deeply
within these ruins lies an artifact of ancient illithid manufacture.
This item is all that stand between the illithids and their nefarious
goal: complete and utter domination.<BR><BR><i>Dawn of the Overmind</i>
is the third adventure in a trilogy (originating with <a href="ma-i1.htm"><i>
A Darkness Gathering</i></a> and continuing in <a href="ma-i2.htm"><i>
Masters of Eternal Night</i></a>). It can be played alone or linked
with the other two parts of the trilogy to form an epic-length
adventure. The illithid trilogy supports <a href="ma-i.htm"><i>
The Illithiad</i></a>, a MONSTROUS ARCANA, supplement that contains
invaluable information on every facet of illithid life, psychology,
technology, and ability.
