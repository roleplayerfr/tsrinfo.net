<tr><td><i>What's the point?</i><BR><BR>
This site is dedicated to cataloging the Dungeons & Dragons game
produced by TSR. Basically it is something I thought should already
be out there, but after much searching without any success, I decided
to just do it myself. Ideally it can serve as a checklist and a
reference guide for both players and collectors alike. It is an
ongoing project, and is updated as I have time. If you are aware of
any errors I have made or items that have been missed please feel free
to e-mail me at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#523f273f373c263d332126122b333a3d3d7c313d3f"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4f223a222a213b202e3c3b0f362e272020612c2022">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Do you sell any of these items?</i><BR><BR>As a general rule, no. Everything
you see here is part of my own personal collection. Occasionally I end
up with extras of some items - they usually go out on <a href="http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?MfcISAPICommand=ViewListedItems&amp;userid=blackdougal&amp;include=0&amp;since=30&amp;sort=2&amp;rows=25">eBay</a>,
which I recommend for those of you searching for out of print gaming. I also
highly recommend <a href="http://www.nobleknight.com/">Noble Knight Games</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Do you buy any items?</i><BR><BR>There are a few hard to find items I'm
currently looking for:<BR><ul><li>
Ghost Tower of Inverness - limited edition
<li>ST1 Up the Garden Path
<li>Jade Hare - with cover
<li>Many various foreign items - very high interest in Japanese releases
<li>RPGA items and other TSR-related merchandise (not the action figures, though)
</ul>
If you have any of these that you are
interested in getting rid of (or something else oddball and hard to find) please <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e28090878c84908d95a2848e83918acc8c8796">let me know</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>When are you going to post </i>Item X<i>?</i><BR><BR>At this
point I've pretty much scanned every item I own. I welcome submissions
for items that do not currently have scans or information listed.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Why isn't </i>Item X<i> listed in </i>Section Y<i>?</i><BR><BR>Basically,
if a product has a game world logo on it, you'll find it in that game
world's section; if not, then it will be in the general section. So
an adventure that is established in a certain world (such as Against the
Giants) will be in the regular AD&D section because is doesn't actually
have a Greyhawk logo on it.<BR><BR>Right now all of the first
and second edition AD&D items are all lumped together, though I may
split them up at some point in the future. Likewise all of the D&D items
are all together including original D&D, Basic, Expert, Companion, Master,
Immortal and Challenger series.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>What's your deal? Have you no life?</i><BR><BR>Actually, yes,
I have an overwhelmingly full life...that's why its taken me so long to
get everything posted. I have a job, a wife and four young children.
I work on the site a half an hour here and an hour there. Though I
haven't had the time to play in several years, I enjoy keeping up with
all of the new material.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>So why bother?</i><BR><BR>As hokey as it may sound, I enjoy giving
something back to the role-playing community that has given me so
much. When all's said and done, more than anything else, RPGs are
about fun, friendship and fond memories that will last a lifetime.
Yes, Greg, you can mock me now. ;)
