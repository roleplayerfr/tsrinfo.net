<center><i>"I dreamt that as the skies blackened with the onslaught of
Chaos,<BR>a dark lord emerged from the Abyss."<BR><BR>-Comment overheard
in a temple of Palanthas,<BR> 383AC (Anonymous)</i></center><BR><b>I</b><i>n
the heat of an unnaturally warm summer, the Knights of Takhisis conquer
nearly every inch of Ansalon, even the glorious city of Palanthas.
Mere days later a messenger arrives in Palanthas bearing a dire
missive: Something wiped out the Knights posted at the Tower of the
High Clerist and now cuts a swath of destruction across the countryside!<BR><BR>
Chaos Spawn</i> pits your heroes against one of Chaos's strongest
minions: the Daemonlord. They must race against time to save the city
of Maelgoth and its citizens from a terrible fate at the hands of this
spawn of Chaos. If it razes Maelgoth, the Lord of Daemons may grow too
powerful for anyone to stop - your heroes are Ansalon's last best hope!<BR><BR>
<i>Chaos Spawn</i> uses the AD&D game rules and provides information
suitable for running the adventure using the SAGA rules as well. This
adventure and its companion, <a href="fa-seeds.htm"><i>
Seeds of Chaos</i></a>, detail the epic battles of the Chaos War,
described in the novel <i>Dragons of Summer Flame</i> by Margaret
Weis and Tracy Hickman.
