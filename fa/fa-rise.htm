<center><b>EVIL GROWS IN THE HEART OF THE OGRE LANDS</center><BR>D</b><i>uring
the Age of Dreams, ogres were beautiful creatures who built fantastic cities
and ruled over the greatest civilization on all of Krynn. They eventually
fell prey to their own decadence - their culture collapsed into barbarism
while the ogres themselves degenerated into their current repulsive forms.
Recently, however, a new form of ogre has emerged. These titans are
gigantic, highly intelligent creatures who claim to hold the key to
regaining the ogres' lost beauty and power. Already the titans have begun
to reclaim their former position in Ansalon through conquest and slavery!<BR><BR>
Rise of the Titans</i> contains detailed accounts of ogre cultures,
describes the countries of Blöde and Kern, provides new hero roles, and
introduces rules for playing ogre heroes. It also presents an adventure
that takes your heroes deep into the ogre realms to rescue kidnapped
Silvanesti diplomats and prevent the titans from spreading their evil
across the face of Ansalon.<BR><BR><BR><BR><center><i>Featuring a story concept
by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman<BR><BR>Rise of the Titans</i> is the second
in the Battle Lines series of adventures that tie in with the War of Souls
novel series. This adventure is playable with the SAGA game rules
introduced in the <a href="fa-box.htm">DRAGONLANCE: FIFTH
AGE</a> boxed set and with the AD&D game as well.</center>
