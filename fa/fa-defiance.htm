<center><b>THE UNSUNG HEROES OF ANSALON.</b></center><BR>No on knows
their names. There are no Sturm Brightblades or Half-Elvens among them.
Yet for as long as Good has struggled against Evil, they have fought
alongside the heroes famed of song and story.<BR><BR>They are the rogues,
spies, diplomats, and scouts of Ansalon, the heroes whose coming goes
unheralded and whose passing goes unnoticed. Although the generations
will never rally around their legends, these secret freedom fighters
remain vital to the struggle. All too often, heroes whose names we
know would have failed without the efforts of men and women whose names
are lost.<BR><BR><i>Heroes of Defiance</i> offers background on these
heroes and guidelines for playing them in the DRAGONLANCE: FIFTH AGE
setting. The handbook in this box, titled <i>Cloak and Dagger</i>,
includes:<BR><BR>Roles for playing bards, guild thieves, kender handlers,
rebel elves, and more!<BR><BR>Guidelines for creating adventures full
of intrigue and mystery, as well as an introduction to some of the
kingpins of "underground" Ansalon.<BR><BR>Optional rules for playing
gully dwarf heroes and for creating the mysterious personalities and
hidden agendas that rogue heroes thrive upon.<BR><BR>Geographic and
historical details on Northern Ergoth, the birthplace of such roguish
traditions as bard colleges and thief guilds. Now emerging as the hub
of civilization in the Age of Mortals, this unique island is also
beautifully presented on a full-color illustrated poster map.<BR><BR>
This boxed set also features <i>Storm Over Krynn</i>, a quest to
uncover the truth behind the origin of the terrifying dragonspawn and
learn the secrets of the Blue Dragon's latest scheme. Groups can play
the adventure as Part Two of the <i>Dragons of a New Age</i> cycle or
as a stand-alone scenario. This adventure links with events in the
second FIFTH AGE novel, <i>The Day of the Tempest</i> by Jean Rabe.
