<center>THOSE THE TOWER INVITES MAY ENTER. ALL OTHERS...BEWARE!</center><BR>
Millennia ago, the Wizards of High Sorcery created five magical Towers
to serve as centers of arcane knowledge and to protect their fellowship
of sorcerers from those who would see magic destroyed. Throughout the
centuries, however, mages across the land of Ansalon were persecuted
until today, in the Fifth Age, only one of these remarkable bastions of
magic still stands - the Tower at Wayreth.<BR><BR>Now you can explore
the mysteries of this enigmatic Tower of High Sorcery, where the
archmage Raistlin once faced his arcane Test. Details of this, <i>The
Last Tower</i>, are revealed for the first time ever in the sourcebook
<i>Secrets of the Tower</i>. Sections include:<BR><BR>A history of the
Towers of High Sorcery, and Wayreth in particular.<BR><BR>A travelogue
of the traps and treasures surrounding Wayerth Forest.<BR><BR>Rules for
using magic inside the Tower's unique protective field, which can make
up seem like down of cause the Tower to appear out of nowhere.<BR><BR>
A catalogue of magical items, from tiny trinkets to powerful artifacts.<BR><BR>
A description of the Tower's most important locations, as well as its
mysterious and secretive Master.<BR><BR><i>The Last Tower</i> includes
<i>Adventures in Magic</i>, a book containing scenarios for modern-day
Tests of High Sorcery, trips through Wayreth's dreamlike dungeon, and
an adventure that pits the heroes against Dark Knights, gully dwarves,
and a clever copper dragon in a quest for an artifact that almost
destroyed the Tower. A full-color poster map illustrates Wayreth
Forest in beautiful detail and offers floor plans of the Tower's layout,
for heroes who dare to explore.<BR><BR>In this Tower, where the magic
of High Sorcery lives on, remember to watch your step and mind your
manners - the Master is watching.
