<center><b>NOW MORE THAN EVER, THE WORLD NEEDS HEROES.</b></center><BR>
A generation ago, the War with Chaos heralded a new age for the world
of Krynn - the Age of Mortals. Just as the shattered land of Ansalon
had begun to recover, a new threat from across the sea descended upon
the populace: the Great Dragons. Larger and more fierce than any wyrms
ever to battle in the wars of past ages, these beasts have brought
terrible oppression to the land they now claim. Humans and elves,
dwarves and centaurs, minotaurs and kender all suffer under their
shadow.<BR><BR>But the FIFTH AGE is not without its heroes. Born of
myriad races, these valiant souls found inspiration in legends of the
heroes of yore. They now take up sword and lance, master an almost
forgotten primordial magic, and harness the untold energies of the
human heart to defend their people from the dragon lords of Ansalon.<BR><BR>
DRAGONLANCE: FIFTH AGE is an all new role-playing game that builds on
the foundation of the best-selling novel <i>Dragons of Summer Flame</i>,
by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. The game features the unique SAGA
dramatic adventure rules, designed to reproduce the sweeping romance
and fantastic epics of the DRAGONLANCE tradition. The FIFTH AGE game
contains:<BR><BR><i>Book of the FIFTH AGE</i>, 128 pages detailing the
SAGA rules, a new narrative game system that emphasizes roles over
rules and gives players more game control.<BR><BR><i>Dusk or Dawn</i>,
96 pages introducing the Ansalon of the FIFTH AGE.<BR><BR><i>Heroes of
a New Age</i>, a 48-page introductory dramatic adventure.<BR><BR>The
Fate Deck, 82 colorful cards that govern all aspects of game play.<BR><BR>
A full-color poster map of Ansalon at the dawn of the FIFTH AGE.<BR><BR>
18 character cards featuring the greatest heroes and villains of the
FIFTH AGE, plus a pre-generated party of heroes.<BR><BR>The challenge is
upon all of us!
