<i>"When the Storms of Chaos rage, even gods seek safe harbor."<BR>
-Augury readings in Palanthas, 383 AC (Anonymous)<BR><BR>Krynn swelters
in the grip of unnatural heat - a summer so dry and scorching the very
world seems ready to burst into flame. Across this baked landscape,
Lord Ariakan's armies of Dark Knights sweep unchecked. Finally, the
great city of Palanthas, the jewel in Ansalon's crown, awaits the
onslaught of unstoppable legions.</i><BR><BR>In <i>Seeds of Chaos</i>,
players have their choice of roles:<BR><BR>The proud Knights of
Takhisis, dark paladins who have sworn a blood oath to their lord.
Adhering to strict codes of honor and discipline, they lead the attack
against the pristine Palanthas; or<BR><BR>Defenders drawn from the
populace of that imperiled city, waging the battle with whatever tools
and tactics come to hand.<BR><BR>In either case, the characters
ultimately learn of their true enemy - a horde of chaos creatures
lurking unseen beyond the northern horizon, poised to render every
wordly conflict obsolete.<BR><BR><i>Seeds of Chaos</i> uses the AD&D
game rules and provides information suitable for running the
adventure using the SAGA rules as well. It is the start of a new
adventure series that details the epic battles of the Chaos War,
described in the novel <i>Dragons of Summer Flame</i> by Margaret
Weis and Tracy Hickman. This series can serve as a stand-alone
campaign or as a crossover to introduce classic DRAGONLANCE players to
the current FIFTH AGE setting.<BR><BR><center><i>To receive a free
