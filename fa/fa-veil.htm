<center>Learn the Secrets of the Silvanesti Elves!</center><BR><i>For
centuries, the Silvanesti elves remained aloof from the rest of Krynn.
Many times they retreated to their sacred forest, taking no part in
world events until some outside force invaded their sanctum. Soon
after Chaos ascended to power on Ansalon, the Silvanesti took extreme
measures - magically shielding themselves from humans, dwarves, dragons,
and even other elves.</i><BR><BR>As the years passed, those outside the
Silvanesti Shield wondered what was going on behind it. Some even
attempted to penetrate the barrier or bring it down. But the shield
never yielded.<BR><BR>Let your heroes be the first to set foot into
lands newly exposed by the mysteriously retracting shield and find out
secrets of the Silvanesti Forest heretofore known only to the elves.
Life has not been idyllic for those inside the sylvan veil. In fact,
your heroes find themselves on a desperate quest to save an elven city
from extinction.<BR><BR>More than just an adventure, this book also
details Silvanesti culture and politics, geography and places of
interest, important individuals, and elven magical items and artifacts.
Players can use <i>The Sylvan Veil</i> to flesh out their Silvanesti
heroes, while Narrators will find an abundance of ideas for further
adventures in the forest and its environs.<BR><BR>Discover the Mysteries
Behind the Veil!<BR><BR><i>Featruring a story concept by Margaret Weis
and Tracy Hickman<BR><BR>The Sylvan Veil</i> is the first in the Battle
Lines series of adventures and novels that tie in with the much
anticipated War of Souls novel series. This adventure is playable both
with the SAGA game rules introduced in the <a href="fa-box.htm">
DRAGONLANCE: FIFTH AGE boxed set</a> and with the AD&D game as well.
