A little information is a very frightening thing.<BR>Hundreds of years
ago, the elves and the goblinkin fought for control of known space in
the Unhuman War. Though the elves won that first campaign, they know
the goblinkin are clamoring for a rematch. Recently the elves
commissioned a few good adventurers to infiltrate the base of a new
race of advanced orcs known as the scro. They were hoping to gain
information on their enemies' numbers and plans.<BR>The news they
found was far worse.<BR>The scro have discovered a weapon of awesome
destruction, one that can lay waste to entire worlds. But the key to
unlock its power lies lost and forgotten.<BR>Even now the scro are
searching for it. When they find it, they will wreak destruction and
revenge on the inhabited planets.<BR>The elves are looking for an
adventuring team who can win this desperate race, and find the key
first. Your PCs may be the only thing that stands between known space
and doom.<BR><i>Heart of the Enemy</i> is a 96-page adventure set in
the Second Unhuman War. The second of a two-part series, it can
either be linked with the previous <a href="sj-sjs1.htm"><i>
Goblins' Return</i></a> or it can be played as a stand-alone adventure.<BR>
<i>Heart of the Enemy</i> is designed for four to six characters of
levels 8-11.
