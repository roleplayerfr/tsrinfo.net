Toril: that blue-green orb on which live Elminster, Lhaeo, and the
Harpers, to name but a few. The planet so many adventurers call
"home." To many, it seems to be the center of the universe.<BR><BR>
Far be that from the truth! There are seven other planets in Toril's
system, some closer to the primary star, other farther from its warmth.
These pages revel the little-known facts about every planet in <i>
