Different worlds have different laws. But everywhere you go, you're
going to find people who bend and break those laws and turn a healthy
profit doing it. Wheter sailing the high seas or the Flow, they are
called pirates.<BR>It's these pirates that you've been hired to hunt.
With letters of marque in your mapcase, your job is to track down and
capture, alive or dead, some of the most dangerous characters in the
known (and unknown) spheres.<BR>Of course, not everyone in space is a
pirate. You'll also meet Torgan Betz (a man famous for bending the
laws, rarely breaking them), Tiktitik, the Thri-kreen crusader, "Thought
Taker," the illithid, and the feared Drow commander Teela Darkcloud.
Even so, they all have their personal agendas, and it's often hard to
tell enemies from friends.<BR><i>Skull & Crossbows</i> is an anthology
of adventures for the SPELLJAMMER campaign setting. This 64-page
anthology easily follows <a href="sj-sja1.htm"><i>Wildspace</i></a>,
but can be used in any existing AD&D SPELLJAMMER campaign.<BR><BR>This
adventure is designed for a party of four to six characters, levels 6
to 10.
