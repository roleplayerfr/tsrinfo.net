For centuries, the intelligent races of Krynn have looked upward,
toward the moons, planets, stars, and the very crystal sphere of
Krynnspace. They have looked up and wondered, and gone back to their
planetbound lives.<BR><BR>Meanwhile, on other worlds in other spheres,
spelljamming ships have begun to venture into the Void; they have
encountered vast evil - and vast wealth - in the trackless reaches of
wildspace. Their ships have explored their own spheres and are even
now moving toward Krynnspace.<BR><BR>And on Krynn, the art of
spelljamming is stirring. Unbeknowst to most of the inhabitants,
spelljamming ports are opening. Spelljammers from other spheres are
exploring the planet, and explorers from Krynn are rising into the sky
and into space. Soon the mysteries of Reorx, Chislev, the Black Clouds,
and the dark planet Nehzmyth will be yielded up - or will destroy
those seeking to investigate.<BR><BR>Now you can add spelljamming to
your Krynn-based campaign with Krynnspace, an accessory for the
SPELLJAMMER campaign setting. The <a href="sj-box.htm">
SPELLJAMMER boxed set</a> is needed to use this booklet.<BR><BR>This
96-page booklet includes:<BR><BR>Details on the planets, moons, and
special mysteries of Krynnspace.<BR>Statistics for all the major NPCs
who inhabit the planets, or who roam wildspace as privateers or pirates.<BR>
Statistics and descriptions for new monsters, magical items, and
encounters.<BR>Short adventure hooks to make designing Krynnspace
scenarios a snap.<BR><BR>SPECIAL BONUS: A full-sized map of the
Krynnspace crystal sphere, showing all the planets and their orbits.
