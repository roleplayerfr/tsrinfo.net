Although Oerth is the dominant world in Greyspace, it is definitely
not the only cradle of life in this system. Worlds such as Kule,
Borka, and Edill have their own civilizations. Each has its own
secrets to entice and threaten explorers courageous enough to brave the
perils of Wildspace.<BR><BR>This book details the dragons of Edill,
the undead of Gnibile, the humanoids of Borka, and many others. It
describes their societies, their views of the universe around them, and
their relationships to the other inhabitants of the Greyspace system.<BR><BR>
But the planetary denizens of Greyspace are not the only challenges
awaiting brave adventurers! There are also spacefaring companies and
starborn peddlers, adventuring groups, explorers' societies, and
interplanetary pirates. In addition, the crystal sphere is home to
monsters totally unlike those encountered anywhere else: the porton,
the skykine, and the dreaded horg.<BR><BR><i>Greyspace</i> is a 96-page
accessory for the SPELLJAMMER campaign setting. The <a href="sj-box.htm">
SPELLJAMMER boxed set</a> is needed to use this product. The material
in this accessory will enhance any GREYHAWK campaign in which the
concept of spelljamming has been (or is about to be!) introduced. Your
players are in for new excitement!
