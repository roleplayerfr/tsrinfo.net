Welcome to the city of twilight, the city of thieves, the city among
the stars. Founded by pirates, Bral is now a prosperous city of
rogues and merchants, adrift in the vast realms of Wildspace. Its
docks are crowded with graceful ships, its streets are teeming with
intrigue and adventure, and its population includes shining heroes and
dark villains. The Rock of Bral is a haven for any adventurer with a
quick wit and a dash of greed - oppurtunity only awaits the hand bold
enough to seize it!<BR><BR><i>Rock of Bral</i> is an accessory to the
SPELLJAMMER campaign setting and is intended to provide a ready guide
to this most fascinating of cities. Your character will find the
Rock to be the perfect base from which to explore the magical reaches
of Wildspace.
