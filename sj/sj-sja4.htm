Few creatures inhabiting the realms of Greyspace, Krynnspace, and
Realmspace know (or even dream) of each others' existence. Fewer still
understand the celestial bonds they secretly share.<BR>As the worlds of
men and elves, dwarves and dragons are about to discover, no less than
<i>TWELVE</i> unknown spheres stand poised for war...a war as unexpected
as it will be devastating!<BR>Twelve spheres against three - hardly
fair odds. But then again, Emperor Vulkaran the Dark, Master of the
Twelve Spheres and Ruler of All Known Space, doesn't like a fair fight.
He's never fought one yet!<BR><i>Under the Dark Fist</i>, a 64-page
aventure for the SPELLJAMMER setting, provides enough material to wage
an intergalactic war across 15 spheres! It can be used as an epic
stand-alone adventure or easily incorporated into an existing campaign.
This challenging adventure is recommended for experienced players and
referees.<BR><BR>This adventure is designed for a party of four to
eight characters, levels 10 to 14.
