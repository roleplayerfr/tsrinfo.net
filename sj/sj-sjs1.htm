Hundreds of years ago, the elves and goblinkin fought for control of
known space in the Unhuman War. The elves emerged victorious and the
goblinkin were driven out to lick their wounds and plot revenge for
another day.<BR>That day has come.<BR>After centuries of plotting and
building, a new race of advanced orcs known as the scro have rallied
the goblins, hobgoblins, and kobolds. It is only a matter of time
before they infiltrate known space to wreak destruction on the
