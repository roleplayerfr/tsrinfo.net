<center><b>The Blood of War Runs Deep</b><BR><BR>As the god of war
died, his blood fell from the sky and burned through the earth into
the lost caverns beneath. Bold warbands willing to brave the perils of
this ancient place have found the remains of a mighty civilization.
And something even greater.<BR><BR>The blood of Stratis still burns hot
in the deep earth. Those strong enough to claim it fight with his fury
on their battlefield.<BR><BR>Every faction has come here to claim this
lost power, bolstered by new forces. The Crazed Minotaur Cultist, the
Ogre Delver, the Pulverizer, the Stonechild and more, all fight to
possess that which was lost.<BR><BR>If you are to succeed in the
unending darkness, you must perfect new tactics.<BR>This guidebook will
begin your training.<BR>Master it, and be victorious.<BR><BR>Time to
throw down.<BR><BR>Underground.</center>
