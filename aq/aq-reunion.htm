Once, the Tribe of Altair roamed the sands, free as the great eagle on
the wind. Now, caged by an evil mage, these desert riders yearn for
their lost freedom. But Fate takes a hand as a noble djinn seeks to
fulfill an ancient wish....<BR><BR>In this unusual three-part scenario,
players take the roles of the men of the tribe, who stage a revolt
after being enslaved in the Pit of the Laughing Efreeti and then try
to battle their way to freedom. In the second part, the PCs are the
women of the tribe, who must escape the evil flame mage's harem and
use all their wits to win free of a strange city. Finally, the
children of the tribe have to slip away from an evil temple before they
can be sacrificed, which calls for them to embark on a magic carpet
ride that promises to be the adventure of their lifetimes.<BR><BR><i>
An AL-QADIM adventure for up to six characters.</i>
