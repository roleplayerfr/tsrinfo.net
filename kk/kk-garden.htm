<center><b>SOMETHING UNNATURAL LURKS IN THE JUNGLE...</b></center><BR><i>Clahz
was a simple druid leading a simple life, cultivating his garden within the
Vohven Jungle. When this garden was brutally destroyed, he did not feel
hatred - only a deep, burning determination. After bargaining with a creature
from the lower planes, he secured himself a perfect spot for a new garden - in
the center of the now-lost City of the Elders. Years of toil and labor led to
the creation of a garden the likes of which the world has never seen, before or
since. At the center of its Empire was the City of Elders, and at the city's
center was the Garden of Clahz, now called the Plantmaster - truly one of the
wonders of Tellene. But when the crippling Green Rot began to ear away at the
garden, and then spread to humans, Clahz was given an ultimatum - find a way
to cure the Green Rot within 20 days, or his marvelous garden would be burned
to the ground. In desperation, he turned again to the dark powers. Only his
screams were ever heard again... and then thing began spilling out of the
garden.</i><BR><BR>This adventure supplement takes fantastic jungle and garden
