<i><center><b>Beware the dark embrace of evil...</b></center><BR>The
shadowed streets and alleys of the City of Rogues echo with cries of
terror... cries that herald the arrival of an evil cult and the terrible
beast they worship. A small village becomes the focus of strange
kidnappings, warrin magical creatures, and a magical treasure hidden
beneath a long-abandoned barrow mound. A northern logging community
fights a desperate battle against pestilence and plague, a dangerous
tribe of orcs, and a wronged enemy from the past. A hobgoblin host
enters the lands of the Free City of Bronish, and the call goes out to
their gold dragon protector. But he does not answer...</i><BR><BR>This
accessory provides four distinct role-playing adventures for use
seperately or as part of an ongoing campaign. Each adventure includes
hooks to draw the player characters in, as well as suggestions on how
to tie each adventure into other Kingdoms of Kalamar adventures.<BR><BR>
The Lands of Mystery fantasy game supplement and adventure is an
official 3rd Edition translation of four adventure supplements previously
published as the Sirocco's Kiss, In Too Deep, Night of the Rotlord and
Unguarded Hoard.<BR><BR><i>Like all Kenzer & Company products, this
