<center><i><b>Tragedy strikes the family Brodeln!</b></i></center><BR><i>
Duke Aldriv III has been brutally murdered. His brother, Prince Cardor,
disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Mordeln, the bastard son
of the Prince, is under suspicion. But Mordeln claims to be innoccent,
and fears he will be the assassins' next target. Let your player
characters' personalities come alive as they join forces with Mordeln in
his desperate race to find his missing father. Will the players find
the Prince before the assassins' do? Or will they too fall victim to
the mysterious figure manipulating the events from behind the scenes?<BR><BR>
This accessory provides characters with a chance for every type of
adventure: town, wilderness, and dungeon. You will take you player
characters through southern Mendarn, to the Duchy of Etwerl, within the
village of Yelden, into the dungeons of Castle Brodeln, deep in the
Narond Forest, and up the Yan Elenon Mountains. What will be more
perilous, running from the law in the village of Yelden, crossing the
path of the mysterious Rascal Gang that preys upon unsuspecting innoccents
in the Narond Forest, entering the lair of the Shano-Kyr goblins,
meeting the orcs of the Severed Leg tribe, dealing with the slaver
clerics of Pel Brolenon or actually getting to the bottom of the
mystery and fighting the person or persons responsible for the crimes?
Only time will tell as events come to a head in southern Mendarn with
your players woven into the middle.<BR><BR></i>The <i>Aldriv's Revenge</i> fantasy
game supplement and adventure is set in the popular Kingdoms of Kalamar
