<center><b><i>The dead are rising... again.</b></center><BR>Over three
hundred years ago, the wise and beautiful Queen Simura lost her only
love to a horrid disease. In a desperate attempt to restore life to
her beloved Gallanos, the Queen turned to necromancy, and became
seduced by the evil power of a mystical tome: the Darklight Codex.
Constructing a gigantic maze beneath her palace, the Queen began to
gather followers, as the dead throughout the land began to rise.
Suddenly, a fanatical group of warrior-priests attacked the palace, and
succeeded in sealing the Queen and her followers within their own
stronghold. As time passed, the city crumbled, and to most people the
story of the Queen is now only a legend. Now terror grips the land -
children are being kidnapped, plague is spreading, and the dead are
rising again. And deep beneath the palace ruins, in the heart of the
maze, the Queen begins to awaken from her long sleep, her power even
greater than before.</i><BR><BR>While in the Principality of Pekal,
the heroes become isolated from the surrounding world by a combination
of disease quarantine and undead activity. Adventurers will face
their darkest fears, as they become entangled in an investigation of
ancient evils, unhallowed life and sudden death. This accessory provides
characters with a chance for several types of adventure: wilderness,
town, and dungeon. Set in a small area on the southernmost shore of
Eb'Sobet Lake, your players will be embroiled in a tale of madness,
kidnappings, murder, and undying love. How will they manage to survive
even one of the many dangers that await them?<BR><BR>
