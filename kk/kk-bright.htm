<i>In the seemingly peaceful city of Geanavue, mysterious conflicts begin
to erupt, placing every citizen in great jeopardy. Only a brave and
intrepid group of adventurers can hope to solve the problem, for
treacherous information brokers, wealthy nobles, scheming clerics and
dangerous creatures and minions all stand in the way. The city calls out
for aid, but are you strong enough to face such a challenge? Step inside...
if you dare.<BR><BR>Like all Kenzer and Company products, this adventure
was designed with the Dungeon Master in mind. We prepare all the details
so you can spend less time flipping pages and more time gaming. Being a
DM has never been so easy, or so much fun! Here's some of what you get:</i><BR><BR>
<ul><li>48 pages of useful background, maps, artwork and adventure details;
no useless fluff!<li>Over three dozen NPC profiles and statistics,
including all of the major players and most of the minor ones.<li>Includes
the new watchman variant class, a new magic item, details on the city-state
of Geanavue, and more.</ul><BR><b>All done in the quality you've come to
expect from Kenzer and Company.</b><BR><BR>Although easily converted for
use in any campaign setting, this book is designed for the Kingdoms of
Kalamar Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting - a realistic, dynamic world
where complex political alliances mix with marauding bands of humanoids,

fantastic. Whatever type of adventure you seek, you can find it here.<BR><BR>
