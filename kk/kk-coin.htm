<i>This heart-pounding adventure is the culmination of an epic battle
between good and evil. The adventure comes to a head as the players,
now armed with the means to destroy the wicked Coin of Power, tread
cautiously into thew Lands of Skarrna to confront their evil nemesis,
Daresh the wizard, in her home territory. Her humanoid forces grow in
daunting numbers. Can the players stop her before her power grows
beyond control?</i><BR>This accessory provides characters with a
fantastic storyline and a chance for many types of adventures
including wilderness, town, infiltrating a castle, dungeons and more.
You will take your player characters from the cosmopolitan City-State of
Zoa up Reanaaria Bay to the Lands of Skarrna and the wild Rokk Woods.
Danger lurks in nearly every corner of Skarrna as major battles take
place bewtween the Skarn people and gnolls and hobgoblins under the
command of the power-hungry, upstart wizard Daresh.<BR>The Coin's End
