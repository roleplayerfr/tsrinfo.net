<center><b>UNIQUE CHARACTER, UNIQUE VISION</b></center><BR>Welcome to
Tellene! This book provides the basic details of life in the Kingdoms of
Kalamar campaign setting, and fills in all the details to flesh out the
history of a player or non-player character. The Player's Primer is
divided into several sections, each of which help players recognize what
their characters know and what they believe (often the two are quite
different), and includes many helpful tables and charts. A must have for
any player or Dungeon Master!<BR><BR><ul><li>Character Knowledge! Now,
you know what your character knows, based on his or her place of origin.
Find out common views on race, religion and government, along with local
history and superstitions!<li>Career History! What did your character do
before becoming an adventurer? After all, even the most dangerous fighters
rarely chose adventuring as their first career. Learn about the work
or apprenticeship in your character's youth that turned him or her against
the simple life, and towards a life of adventure!<li>Religious Views!
Gain insight on how devotees of one religion view other allied or
opposing religions. This section also includes comprehensive deity charts.
Useful material for both clerics and non-clerics alike!<li>Quick Roll
Background Tables! Create a detailed character history, including
information about other members of your family. Add a degree of
believability to your characters, and discover a richer and more enjoyable
roleplaying experience!<li>Random Name Tables! Expanded tables include
new names for all of the major human and humanoid races on Tellene!</ul><BR><BR>
Although usable in any campaign, this book uses the Kingdoms of Kalamar
campaign setting as a base for descriptive text and cultural details. In
this realistic, dynamic world, complex political alliances mix with
marauding bands of humanoids, and medieval technology and culture comes
face to face with magic and the fantastic. Whatever type of adventure
you seek, you can find it here.<BR><BR>This Kingdoms of Kalamar supplement
is intended for use by D&D players and Dungeon Masters (DMs) alike.
