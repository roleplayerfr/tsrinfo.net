This <i>KINGDOMS OF KALAMAR</i> w orld supplement is for DMs and
players alike. It includes expanded information on the nation of
Pekal. From the powerful College of Magic to the war with the Kingdom
of Tokis, Pekal is in the middle of it all. Explore the Principality
of Pekal and keep your wits about you as you become involved in the
long-running intrigues of the various secular, political, subversive,
magic and religious organizations of the realm. As this book includes
character creation guidelines for the <b><i>Living Kingdoms of Kalamar</i></b>
campaign, it is ideal for learning about RPGA member driven organized
play or for independent home use. The Pekal Gazetteer also includes
two new <i>KINGDOMS OF KALAMAR</i> adventures for low level characters
to use in any campaign!<BR><BR><i>Like all Kenzer & Company products, this adventure
was designed with the Dungeon Master in mind. We prepare all the details
