<i>Stand and Deliver is a first level Dungeons & Dragons adventure set in
the Kingdoms of Kalamar campaign setting. This adventure is designed for
use with the revised edition of the Dungeons & Dragons rules with key
differences from the previous editions called out so it can be more easily
used with either edition. The player characters will become entangled in
a tragic tale of forbidden love among different social classes and soon
find themselves embroiled in a challenging contest of skill to decide the
fate of people's lives. They will find themselves investigating the
haunted ruins of Guvlven looking for clues to the unexplained disapperance
of the original settlers and soldiers centuries ago. While in the
wilderness they will meet the mysterious Mashony tribe and learn of their
dire need for assistance in sanctifying a sacred temple that has been
defiled. But can they be trusted? For the tomb holds many secrets,
riddles and dangers of which not even they are aware.</i><BR><BR>Stand and
Deliver blends just the right amount of plot, social intrigue, riddles,
combat, traps and magic to provide a fantastic springboard for any DUNGEON
MASTER to start a new D&D campaign.<BR><BR>
