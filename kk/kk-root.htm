<i>In the small town of Haanex on Reanaaria Bay, the wizard Veoden
assembles the PCs to do a simple job: find the remnants of a meteor
said to be made of the rare substance mithral. First they must find a
map that local rumor tells is guarded by the spirits of the dead.<BR>
Upon recovering the map and locating the crater, they uncover a plot to
create a powerful magical item called the Coin of Power. This artifact
is a tool for wickedness and the players soon find themselves on a
quest to learn the means to destroy this evil item and its insidious
master before she destroys them.<BR>Complicating matters is the fact
that the one man who can help them was lost during an expedition to
the Reelio Jungle months ago and is yet to return. Will the PCs be
able to survive the rigors of the jungle and solve the riddle of the
tribesmen who live there? The lives of innocents might depend on it!
This accessory provides characters with an elaborate storyline and a
chance for many varied types of adventure. You will take your PCs
from the quiet village of Haanex in northern Reanaaria Bay to the Vry
Naasu Headlands, the City-State of Zoa and finally the forlorn Reelio
Jungle.</i><BR><BR>The Root of All Evil fantasy game supplement is set
