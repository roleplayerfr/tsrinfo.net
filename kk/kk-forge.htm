<center><b><i>A Scavenger Hunt?</i></b></center><BR>The adventure begins
in the City-State of Zoa as the wizard Geolain tasks the player characters
with a quest to gather three ingredients that they will use to forge a
magic coin to defeat an evil wizard. Which will be more dangerous to
collect, the mysterious diamond touched by death, the blood of a devil
spilled by a coward or a blue dragon's breath? As the player characters
race around Reanaaria Bay to find the rare items, their nemesis Daresh
the wizard begins to grow in strength and wrest power from the Skryvalkkers
of the Lands of Skarrna. Will the player characters find the ingredients
and enchant the coin in time? They just might be Skarrna's only hope.<BR>
This accessory provides characters with a fantastic storyline and a
chance for many types of adventure including deserted ruins, city
skirmishes and power brokering, waterborne, a desert jaunt and humanoid
lair. You will take your player characters from the cosmopolitan
City-State of Zoa to the outlying haunted farms, across Reanaaria Bay to
the treacherous southern Khydoban Desert. If they escape with their
lives from the blue dragon who lives there they will be off to Xaarum to
hunt a devil and then return to the troublesome streets of the City-State
of Zoa where they know not whom they can trust!<BR>The Forging Darkness
fantasy game supplement and adventure is set in the popular Kingdoms of
Kalamar Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting but can be adapted for use
in any setting! Forging Darkness is a Dungeons and Dragons adventure
for 3rd to 4th level characters.<BR><BR>Like all Kenzer & Company products, this
adventure was designed with the DM in mind. We prepare all the details
so you can spend less time flipping pages and more time gaming. Being
a Dungeon Master has never been so easy, or so much fun! Here's some

NPC profiles and portraits, maps, encounter tables, a full glossary,
