<center><i><b>Looking for more excitment than your local town or
village can give you?</center></b><BR>Look no further, friend. Welcome
to Geanavue, the Stones of Peace: a completely detailed fantasy city
for D&D campaign play. From the pen of Ed Greenwood, one of the
best-known D&D writers of all time, comes this richly-detailed setting.
Geanavue is a haven of justice and prosperity for your characters - but
one that, for the unwary, can be just as deadly as the monster-haunted
hills. Join fully-developed guilds, and ready your weapons as you
become involved in the long-running intrigues of colorful, detailed
noble families. See famous landmarks and be guided to interesting
shops and underground societies. Hear the local rumors and seek the
dangers that lie behind them. Or simply hide out from the local giants,
pirates and others lurking nearby. Welcome home, adventurers.<BR>
Geanavue is a city designed to be used either as a 'home base' or
simply as a stopover in a Kalamar campaign. From the daily lives of
commoners and castle officials to precarious conditions in the lawless
port of nearby Loona, this sourcebook presents a firm foundation for
years of adventure.</i><BR><BR>Like all Kenzer & Company products, this adventure
was designed with the Dungeon Master in mind. We prepare all the details
so you can spend less time flipping pages and more time gaming. Being
a DM has never been so easy, or so much fun! Here's some of what you
get:<BR><BR><b>RumorQUEST Encounter System</b><BR>The Rumor<b>QUEST</b>
encounter system is the plot disseminator that gamers love. Now DMs
can unravel clues to adventure plots through the normal course of
role-playing instead of using a page long monologue of boxed text.
No more one-line, non-roleplayed rumors in YOUR game: the RumorQUEST
system is here! RumorQUEST encouters make the city come alive around
the players. No longer is the town static. Now NPCs move about,
interact and inadvertently provides tips to players clever enough to
pay attention.<BR><BR>208 pages of useful background, NPC profiles and
statistics, maps, rumors, a full glossary, artwork and campaign
details; no fluff!<BR>Geanavue comes packed with well over 100,000 words
detailing hundreds of noble houses, guilds, inns, taverns, NPCs, spells
and other crunchy bits as well as a beautiful 2-sided poster-sized
map of Geanavue and its under-city.<BR>This sourcebook also introduces
KenzerCo's latest innovation: the RumorQUEST Encounter System, a novel
and elegant method of bringing a city to life while simultaneously
disseminating information (and random encounters!) to the players.<BR><BR>
<b>All done in the quality you've come to
expect of Kenzer & Company.</b><BR><BR>To use this adventure, a Dungeon Master
also needs the <a href="../3e/phb.htm"><i>Player's Handbook</i></a>,
the <a href="../3e/dmg.htm"><i>DUNGEON MASTER'S Guide</i></a>,
and the <a href="../3e/mm.htm"><i>Monster Manual</i></a>. We
