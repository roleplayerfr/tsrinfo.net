<center><b><i>Danger lurks in and around Thygasha, the famous City of
Dreams...</i></b></center><BR><i>A mecca for major religions, in
Thygasha heated theological debate is the norm. Recently, however,
extremists disrupted the peace with mortal combat in the streets. Then,
mysterious thieves stole the Orb of Midnight - an evil artifact hidden
for ages - from its guardians. Certainly this event can only serve to
increases the violence between the strongest religions. Concurrently,
rumors that a second source of Thygasha's renowned Silver Sand had been
discovered caused would-be treasure seekers to foray into the exceedinly
dangerous Khydoban Desert. Only a few lucky souls returned, whispering
tales of vast caverns filled with the valuable Sand. What's more,
several of these survivors financed return expeditions with handfuls of
the expensive material. Now, dozens of expeditions have braved the
rigors of the wasteland, but none have returned. Prince Shyja's
scout troops have disappeared and an ancient burial crypt has suddenly
reappeared.<BR><BR>Your players' personalities will come alive as they
solve these mysteries, battle new foes and more. This is a world
supplement and free-flowing adventure setting with hooks for characters
of any motivation including chivalry, good, villany, greed, power, fame,
knowledge, evil, adventure and more. Characters are provided with a
chance for every type of adventure: city, wilderness and dungeon. You
will take your PCs to the famous City of Dreams on the eastern side of
the Reanaaria Bay, around the Arajyd Mountains, into the foreboding
Khydoban Desert, through two dangerous dungeons, and back again.<BR><BR>
