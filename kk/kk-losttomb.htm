<i>Over five hundred years ago, he came down out of the Elenons at the
head of a fearsome army of hobgoblins. For 13 years, he terrorized
Brandobia and what we now know as The Young Kingdoms. After his
assassination, the tribes he had united fell to civil war over who
would be his successor. Luckily for the rest of Tellene, none
succeeded. For he was Kruk-Ma-Kali, the greatest king of the
hobgoblins and one of history's mightiest warlords. Rivers of gold,
floods of silver and wagonloads of magic flowed into his treasury for
over a decade. They say the treasure hoards of Kruk-Ma-Kali rivaled
those of the Kalamaran Empire at its height. They say his most loyal
followers took the greater portion of it for his Tomb. They say it
lies there still, waiting for those who can prove their worth by
overcoming the many obstacles left to guard the treasure.<BR><BR>For
centuries, adventurers, glory-seekers and gold-hungry dreamers have
sought the mysterious Tomb of Kruk-Ma-Kali. Serious-minded scholars
now speculate that his Tomb is a myth. But rumors never die, and the
lure of the Lost Tomb continues to draw those who believe that they
can overcome the deadly trials and reap the magnificent rewards. Deep
in the dusty stacks of the Great Sanctuary of Knowledge at Dijishy
lies a journal... a tome written by an adventurer who has actually
seen the Tomb entrance. The Tomb is real. But only an intrepid band
of characters prepared to face the horrors and deadly tests left for
them can locate the Tomb and discover the treasure waiting for them.<BR><BR>
Kruk-Ma-Kali came down out of the mountains, and his Tomb must lie
deep in the sinister wilderness, somewhere in the vast expanses of
monster-infested lands that surround the city-state of Dijishy. But
one does not simply walk up to the Tomb and begin looting! It has
been lost for years. Characters will need every resource they have
just to find the Tomb. Within lurk strange magics, terrble traps,
fearsome guardians, and of course Kruk-Ma-Kali's own sword - the
mighty artifact Kharad-khor, called "Bloodthirster" in the Merchant's
Tongue. Only the greatest of heroes can wrest the treasures of the
ancient king away from his grip.</i><BR><BR><b>ImageQUEST Adventure Illustrator</b><BR>
