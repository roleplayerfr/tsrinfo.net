<center><i><b>Can your players discover the fate of the Siren's Prize?</b></center><BR>
Brendlin Orth, a wealthy merchant lord, seeks an adventuring party that
doesn't mind doing some dirty work in exchange for cold, hard coin. It
seems a lighthouse that guides his ships along the Brandobian coast has
ceased to function. The job is simple - go to the lighthouse and see
why the keeper has been neglecting his duty. If he refuses... well,
lighthouse keepers are easy to come by. And the price seems good - too
good. Is there more to the story than Lord Orth is telling? Let your
players beware as they explore the strange lighthouse tower and the
dangerous seaside caves beneath. Their Intelligence, Wisdom, and Strength
will be tested in ways they never imagined, for surprises lurk in
unexpected places, and long-forgotten tales may have more truth buried
in them than even the wisest sage can tell. Will the players unravel
the age-old mystery that lies beneath the tower? Will they find their
way to the fabulous treasure that awaits them at the end of their
quest? What is the terror that destroyed scores of men? The Siren's
Prize awaits!<BR><BR>This accessory provides characters with a chance
for many types of adventure: wilderness, town, underground and
aquatic. Set in a small area on the Brandobian coast, your players
will be embroiled in a tale of tragedy, death and revenge. Beware of
a mage whose quest for knowledge leads to a deadly trap; a scheming
merchant who cares more for his gold than he does for the lives of men;
the brood of hideous aquatic humanoids who live in the seaside caves; a
strange half-man who makes his home in the midst of this danger, and
something even more terrifying that waits for them at the end of their
journey...<BR><BR>Like all Kenzer & Company products, this adventure
was designed with the Dungeon Master in mind. We prepare all the details
