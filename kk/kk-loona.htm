From the pen of Ed Greenwood, one of the most celebrated D&D writers of
all time, flows this richly detailed setting port town for D&D campaign
play.<BR><BR>Enter this ramshackle, lawless chaos where sailors brawl, the
unsavory lurk, and death comes quietly in the night. Beware the diabolical
conspiracies, dark religions, and seedy merchant cabals, as you become
tangled in the webs of intrigue that run through this colorful port town.
Join fully developed guilds and societies, and side with prominent powers
and enigmas, or ready your weapons and attempt to explore the town on your
own. But beware - sometimes the local rumors are even more terrifying
than they appear, and death is only one dark alley away. Welcome to Loona,
adventurers.<BR>Loona is the trade center of the nearby city of Geanavue:
the Stones of Peace - but the politics and alliances of this den of thieves
are even more dangerous for the unwary. Loona can be used either as a
'home base' or simply as a stopover in your campaign. From the salty
Dock District to the Bowery to the better-kept Master's District and all
those in between, this sourcebook presents a firm foundation for years of
adventure.<BR><BR>Like all Kenzer and Company products, this supplement
was designed with the Dungeon Master in mind. We prepare all the details
so you can spend less time flipping pages and more time gaming. Being
a DM has never been so easy, or so much fun! Here's some of what you
get:<BR><BR><ul><li>96 pages of useful background, maps, rumors, adventure
hooks, a full glossary, artwork and campaign details: no fluff!<li>Over
100 NPC profiles and statistics, including all of the major players in
town, and most of the minor ones.<li>Loona also comes packed with nearly
100,000 words detailing inns, taverns, guilds, nobles and more, as well
as a beautiful 2-sided poster-sized map of Loona and the surrounding
countryside.</ul>All done in the quality you've come to
expect of Kenzer and Company.<BR><BR>Although easily converted for use in
any campaign setting, this book is designed for the KINGDOMS OF
KALAMAR DUNGEONS & DRAGONS campaign setting - a realistic, dynamic world
where complex political alliances mix with marauding bands of humanoids,
and medieval technology and culture come face to face with magic and the
fantastic. Whatever type of adventure you seek, you can find it here.<BR>
