<center><b>NOTHING IS WHAT IT SEEMS.</b></center><BR>In the world of Tellene,
Pagari the Fate Scribe is the mighty goddess of prophesy, time and fate. Over
the years, the Prophets, as her clergy is called, have built temples and churches
throughout Tellene. One such sanctuary in the Kakidela Mountains is rumored to
hold dangerous secrets in the catacombs below. Now the reclusive clerics appear
to be abducting innocent people. Can the PCs find out what is going on there
and will they be the ones to fulfill the Fate of Heroes?<BR><BR>This accessory
provides a role-playing adventure for use individually or as part of an ongoing
campaign. It details hooks to draw the player characters in, as well as many
rumors that could lead to other Kingdoms of Kalamar adventures.<BR><BR>
