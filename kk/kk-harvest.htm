<center><b><i>Frightening clues and hints of ancient evil...</i></b></center><BR>
<i>On the outskirts of an unsuspecting village, an evil priest of the
Harvester of Souls kidnaps innoccent victims in an attempted to raise an
undead army. During a religious festival, a manipulative cult steals a
majestic phoenix from the sacred garden of an honorable priesthood. In
the lair of a black dragon, an ancient vampire has returned from a
centuries-long imprisonment, determined to unleash terrible evil
throughout the lands of Tellene. And deep within a mountainous tomb
laden with treasures, the Lords of Blood - leaders of the dark Sharjani
cult - are beginning to awaken from their slumber. Will the player
characters be able to solve these mysteries and wipe out the evil forces
that torment the Young Kingdoms? Or will they even manage to survive
these deadly encounters?<BR><BR>This accessory provides four distinct
role-playing adventures that can be used by themselves or as part of an
ongoing campaign. Each adventure includes hooks to draw the player
characters in, as well as suggestions on how to tie one adventure into
the next with an overall plot thread, and a conclusion that brings all
these stories together and leaves ideas for continuing the adventures
beyond the scope of the book. Each adventure is designed for characters
of specific levels, though the entire campaign series may also be used
to bring player characters from 1st to 10th level and beyond.<BR><BR>
The Harvest of Darkness fantasy game supplement and adventure is set in
the popular</i> KINGDOMS OF KALAMAR <i>fantasy campaign setting. This
work is an official 3rd Edition translation of four adventure supplements
previously published as</i> Sometimes They Come Back, Temple of the Bronze
Flame, A Foe in Need, and The Hungry Undead.<BR><BR><b>ImageQUEST Adventure Illustrator</b><BR>
