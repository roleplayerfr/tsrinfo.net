<center><b>In SoloQuest - YOU are the hero!</b></center><BR>In the bay city of
Zoa, two deadly thieves' guilds war over territory, striking against each other
with threats, competition and swift, brutal acts of violence. You are one such
thief - a young member of the Shadowed Fist guild, and enemy of the Black Blades.
Fortunately, although you are still a mere cutpurse working your way up the
ranks, your brother holds a position of leadership within the Fist, and it is at
least partly due to him that you have survived and prospered as well as you have.<BR>
Suddenly, after completing a routine assignment, you find your brother struck
down without warning by an assassin's poisoned blade! As he lies near death,
you must seek out the antidote to the poison, restore your brother to health,
and revenge yourself upon his attackers. Yes, your brother's survival and the
survival of everyone involved, as well as the conclusion of the adventure, rests
upon your shoulders! Fortunately, if you take the wrong path, you can always
play again. Even after you complete a game, feel free to try again because
this book has more than one ending! Some endings are good, and some endings are
bad. If you come to a bad end, simply play again from the beginning!<BR>As well
as many different paths for adventure, this book includes:<BR><ul><li>Basic and
Advanced Rules! Along with the basic play rules, this adventure also includes
optional advanced rules for more realistic fun!<li>Pregenerated or Custom
Characters! Use the standard character in this book, or bring in your own
Dungeons and Dragons rogue, or HackMaster thief!<li>Dice Tables! Don't have
polyhedral dice with you? No problem! SoloQuest works with or without dice,
thanks to the special dice tables!<li>Quick Reference Tables! Need to look up
an advanced or basic rule quickly? Simply turn to the easy-to-use tables and

the Kingdoms of Kalamar campaign setting to enjoy this book, it utilizes this
official campaign setting as a base for descriptive text and cultural details.

marauding bands of humanoids, and medieval technology and culture come face to
face with magic and the fantastic. Whatever type of adventure you seek, you
