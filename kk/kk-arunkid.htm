Arun'Kid - a small farming village with a sinister legacy. Now, a
group of gnomes who seek vengeance on the hamlet for wrongs done to
them long ago and the return of fantastic riches lost in the shadows of
the past. But to save the village, the heroes must seek answers from
the most unlikely sources. The PCs will do their sleuthing from the
home of a crazy hermit druid and his unique hedge maze to the tomb of a
respected village leader and beyond. Now everyone seems to want to
claim the village of Arun'Kid - the gnomes of the Barleten clan, the
Baron of Salanid and even a murderous band of brigands. But who should
get it may be up to the heroes to decide...</i><BR><BR>This accessory
