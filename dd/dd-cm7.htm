The Feadiel clan's Tree of Life is dying. As the bravest and strongest
elves in the clan, you must undertake the challenge of the elders: seek
out the source of the disease and destroy it.<BR><BR>If you fail, the
Tree of Life will surely perish, and all your family with it. The
quest is great and you may die on the journey, never to find the cause
of the disease. The journey will take you to the deepest part of
ancient Selinar, Elvenhome, to find the guarded grave of the first
Treekeeper.<BR><BR>Delay no longer! The Tree of Life grows weaker,
day by day...
