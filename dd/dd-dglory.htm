one time the community of Dwarven Glory was a thriving and wealthy
community. So wealthy, in fact, that the proud and strengthening
heritage of Dwarf history was forgotten and the community was easy prey
for Mortoc and his 10 Orc Tribes. But, although the Orcs conquered,
they could not completely destroy Dwarven Glory, and there were parts
of the caverns they did not even penetrate.<BR><BR>Now the caverns
echo in the misty gloom, offering refuge to the forgotten and promise
to the adventurer.</td></tr><tr><td><BR></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFDDAA">
