The widow insists there are demons in her house. She hears them at
night in her root cellar, and now they call out to her. But she is old
and nervous and her mind often plays tricks on her.<BR><center>* * *</center><BR>
Two men, their heads fully sheathed in large, black hoods, dig quickly
in the darkness of the cellar. The hole grows deeper as their shovels
bite into the earth.<BR>"This will teach those meddlers their place,"
laughs the tall, hefty figure.<BR>"But it's too bad this was an
accident," the shorter, slim figure says haltingly.<BR>"But don't you
see the advantage?" snapped the tall man. "They will fear us now. They
will fear for their lives."<BR>Grunting. they heave a sailcloth bundle
into the hole. As it falls, a woman's hand dangles lifelessly from the
folds.<BR>Who is the woman? Why will her death trigger riots and unrest
in the city of Specularum?<BR>And the assassins: Are they Torenescu,
Radu, or Vorloi? Or, curse of curses, the Veiled Society?<BR><BR>This
special game adventure provides a section of paper buildings and figures
to cut out and use, giving you three dimensions to your game play!
