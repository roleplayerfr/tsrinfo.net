REVOLT OF THE GLADIATORS!<BR><BR>The corrupt Thyatian senator, <i>
Helenites Osteropolus</i>, his latest scheme smashed by the adventurers
and their gladiator allies, hatches a new plot to destroy the influence
of the Order of the Sands (even, perhaps, to attack the Emperor himself!).
Yet greater dangers lie ahead. If his plot succeeds, it will remove
the guardians that protect the city from the creatures that lurk in the
caverns and catacombs below. Can the players block his gambit? Will
the wheels of justice grind small, or will the greasy palm of political
corruption reach out and save the senator once again? YOU decide, in
the chaotic swirl of the Thyatian capital's politics.<BR><BR>This
