Barely one day's march from Kelven, the uncharted tracts of the Dymrak
forest conceal horrors enough to freeze the blood of civilized folk.
Those who have ventured there tell how death comes quick to the unwary -
for the woods at night are far worse than any dungeon.<BR><BR>But you
are adventurers, veterans of many battles, and the call of the wild is
strong. Will you answer the call, or are you afraid of the dark terrors
of the night?<BR><BR>This campaign adventure is for characters just
beginning Expert play (levels 2-4) and hurls them into the exciting
outdoor world which awaits in the Expert rulebook.<BR><BR>With a 64
page booklet, 2 double-panel covers, a double-sided, fold-out mapsheet
and 120 die-cut counters, this super module provides all you need for
epic wilderness and dungeon adventuring. Journey across the Grand
Duchy of Karameikos in a desperate race against time and the forces of
evil.
