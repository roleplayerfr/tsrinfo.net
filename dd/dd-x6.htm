Swamp creatures! They surround you now as you move slowly through the
gurgling muck. How will you reach Quagmire now? Each day, the hungry
sea swallows more of the ancient port city. A fierce fever ravages its
people, and now - these foul monsters! Their beady eyes glimmer from
deep within the tangled vines. Are these the creatures that have
blockaded the city, turning away ships that are the city's lifeline?
Are these the scum that are starving the people of Quagmire, threatening
an entire race with extinction? These creeps?<BR><BR>Let's clean this
jungle out!<BR><BR>Quagmire includes a large-scale map that expands the
D&D world and introduces new areas to explore. The adventure also
includes new magic items and a special, expanded monsters section.<BR><BR>
Hurry! Hoist your colors, or saddle your horse - go before the city by
the sea becomes the city beneath the sea!
