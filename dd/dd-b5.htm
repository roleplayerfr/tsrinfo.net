The end of the road. A lonely fort stands on the banks of a mighty
river. It is here the hardy bands of adventurers gather to plan their
conquests of The Hill, the hulking mass that looms over this tiny
settlement.<BR><BR>The Hill is filled with monsters, they say, and an
evil witch makes her home there. Still, no visitor to The Hill has
ever returned to prove the rumors true or false. The thrill of
discovery is too great to pass up, and only the river stands in the way.
The adventurers' boat is waiting!<BR><BR>This module is designed for
use with the D&D Basic Rules. A trip through the wilderness begins a
unique challenge for the novice player and Dungeon Master.<BR><BR>
Included in the module are 11 maps, 3 new monsters, and a complete set
of prerolled characters.
