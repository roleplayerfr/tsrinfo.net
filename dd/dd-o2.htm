You are Erystelle of Dorneryll, famed elfin champion and magic-user.
After years of adventuring, you have come home to the Emerlas - the
hauntingly beautiful elfin woodland at the tip of Canolbarth forest. A
place of legends and of peace.<BR><BR>The journey has been long, but
soon the winding forest track will bring you to Dorneryll, the majestic
oak tree home of your childhood. Ahead, you glimpse a plume of smoke
curling lazily into the sky. Dorneryll is close, and your mind floods
with thoughts of home.<BR><BR>Suddenly, your reverie is shattered!
The thin plume of smoke is gone, and in its place a column of red flame
leaps high among the trees.<BR><BR>Dorneryll is under attack! Gripping
your lance, you urge your mount into a gallop. Starbow surges forward;
your war dogs close on her heels...<BR><BR>Blade of Vengeance is an
adventure for one player and one dungeon master, featuring a lone elf
against the forces of evil. Can you save te Emerlas from destruction?
The answer waits inside.
