The storm sweeps off the mountaintops without warning, as if conjured
by some supernatural power. Within minutes, huge drifts of snow have
halted the caravan, and the snow falls so hard it is impossible to see
more than five feet. You huddle next to the sledge, trying to shelter
your numb face from the icy winds.<BR><BR>A dozen half-human forms
march into view out of the raging blizzard. The little man-things
carry wooden spears or long, unsheathed swords in bony, gnarled hands.
Their blood-red eyes quickly fall upon your sledge and the ugly
creatures turn toward your hiding place.<BR><BR>Will you survive to
uncover the secret of Blizzard Pass?<BR><BR>This module contains all
you need to solve the riddle of Blizzard Pass, including 14 maps, an
invisible ink marking pen, a complete solo adventure, a pre-rolled
character, and an outline for group play.
