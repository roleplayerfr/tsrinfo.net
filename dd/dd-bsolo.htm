"A great cat sits upon the northern grasslands, my friend, waiting to
pounce on adventurers just like you." As you part the tall grass with
your sword, the words of the tavernkeeper echo in you head.<BR><BR>"He
was the mightiest wizard we'd ever known, and that Lion Castle was his
home." Your friends' voices mingle with the tavernkeeper's. "He's but
a ghost now, haunting those halls, and waiting for an heir."<BR><BR>The
ground rises slightly. A strong wind rushes through the field. Suddenly,
the grasses part, and Lion Castle rises majestically before you!<BR>
"Magical riches await those who enter!" "Beware of man-beasts!" Voices
flood your head again. Will you brave the haunted castle? Can you
afford not to? It's all up to you in this D&D Solo Adventure.<BR><BR>
Ghost of Lion Castle is for one player only, but that one player makes
all of the choices and enjoys all of the rewards. An entire castle and
courtyard await your exploration. The adventure also includes a complete
solo combat system.
