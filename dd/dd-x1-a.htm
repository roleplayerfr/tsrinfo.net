Hundreds of miles from the mainland, surrounded by dangerous waters,
lies an island known only as the Isle of Dread.<BR><BR>Dark jungles and
treacherous swamps await those who are brave enough to travel inland in
search of the lost plateau, where the ruins of a once mighty
civilization hold many treasures - and many secrets!<BR><BR>The Isle of
Dread is the first in a series of adventures for use with the D&D
Expert rules. The module is designed as an instructional aid to help
novice dungeon masters design their own wilderness adventures.<BR><BR>
Included in the module are 13 maps of the isle, 16 new monsters, and
suggestions for further adventures on the Isle of Dread. A special
continent map, complete with background information, is also included.
