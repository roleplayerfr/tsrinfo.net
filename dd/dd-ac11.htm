Have you ever wondered why, in a world full of magic, there are no
enchanted labor saving devices? Few magical modes of transportation?
No bespelled byproducts of the inventor's art? Wonder no more! They
are all here, in this latest compendium from the Game Wizard's lair:
<i>The Book of Wondrous Inventions</i>!<BR>The Book of Wondrous
Inventions is useable with both the D&D and the AD&D game systems.
Each invention is clearly outlined, including function, form, and
hazards of use. Statistics and spell details are are presented in a
manner compatible with both game systems. Adventure scenario
suggestions are given, as well as design instructions for characters
who wish to build duplicate device.<BR>As an added bonus, a section is
included which details a system for creating spells and magical items.
This will prove especially useful to players and DMs who use the D&D
game system; the detailed information is also of help to AD&D game
players.
