In a dark cell, Rollo Bargamnn, merchant of Thyatis, turns away in
disgust from his evil, green-skinned prisoner; capturing this wretch
cost a ship and sixty gallant men. Then his heart hardens once more,
and he resumes the interrogation. Here, perhaps, he may find an answer
to the question that haunts him.<BR><BR>What new evil is casting its
shadow over the storm-swept eastern reaches of the Sea of Dread?<BR><BR>
The trading routes are no longer safe. The attacks of the green-skinned
"Orcs-of-the-Sea" and the mysterious "Ship-bane" now go unchecked.
Once their raids were random, but the influence of some unseen master
has made them into an organized menace.<BR><BR>Soon the questioning
will be over; Rollo will know enough to track the threat to its lair.
Then he will need a band of hardy adventurers brave enough to take on
the task.<BR><BR>You perhaps?<BR><BR><i>Drums on Fire Mountain</i> is a
module for 5 to 8 characters levels 5-8.
