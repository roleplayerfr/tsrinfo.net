A King's Commission leads to danger! All communication with the barony
of Twolakes Vale has ceased. King Ericall, worried about the security
of his border and angered at the loss of tax revenues, has commissioned
you, a delegation of powerful characters, to investigate.<BR>This is
not a petty problem to be solved by the armies of local nobility.
Indeed, the king's forces are desperately needed elsewhere. Twolakes
Vale is, after all, only a small barony on the far frontier of Ericall's
domain. And yet...<BR>The cloud is there, its nature and cause unknown.
None have returned from the barony for weeks. Furthermore, the cloud is
spreading, and vague reports of unrest and mysterious disappearances
are starting to trickle in from nearby baronies.<BR><BR>Can you discover
the secert of Twolakes Vale?
