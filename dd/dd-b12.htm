The wizard Kavorquian is dead. But certain items belonging to his
adopted son were in the wizard's keeping at the time of his demise.
Now someone must venture into the silent vaults of Kavorquian's
stronghold and recover the missing property.<BR><BR><i>Queen's Harvest</i>
picks up its story where <a href="dd-b11.htm">B11, <i>King's
Festival</i></a>, left off. It can be played as a sequel to that
adventure or as a complete adventure in itself. It is tailored for
beginning Dungeon Masters and players and contains helpful hints on
adventuring and the land of Karameikos. The story develops simply, but
ultimately leads the player characters into the nether reaches of
Penhaligon's politics to confront Ilyana Penhaligon, mad pretender to
the throne!
