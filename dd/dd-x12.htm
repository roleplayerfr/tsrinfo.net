It's a <i>mirror of life trapping</i>, isn't it?<BR><BR>Well, yes and
no. People go in, and they don't come out. Nor can you talk with
anyone inside. Somehow, that's not quite the way you remember those
mirrors work.<BR><BR>This Skarda fellow showed up a few years ago with a
band of raiders, and no one in the land has been safe since then. Whole
villages have disappeared into this Skarda's mirror. Your band is
approached by relatives of one of the victims - an adventurer like
yourselves.<BR><BR>You have to get that mirror of whatever-it-is, find
this man, and get him out in one piece. The reward is more than
adequate. Only problem is, no one out here can tell you what to expect
once you get in - or even how to get there.
