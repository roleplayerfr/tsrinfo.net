Gray Mountain lies deep in the lush elven forest. The temple there
was a haven of meditation and learning - until taken over by an evil
cleric known as the Rahib.<BR><BR>Far under the mountain, he paces
before the temple's great altar. A brown-robed servant rushes in and
falls to his knees, trembling at the sight of the Rahib's black panther.
"Rahib, adventurers came to the village as the sun rose - the strangers
now protect Rahasia."<BR><BR>A scowl crosses the Rahib's face. "I must
have Rahasia! Attack again tonight." As the servant scurries away, a
deep growl rises from the giant cat.<BR><BR>Gripping the panther's
leash, the Rahib paces again, speaking out loud. "We must dispose of
these strangers quickly; the secret beneath the temple will not wait
much longer."
