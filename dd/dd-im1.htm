"The storm-stuff is not matter as we know it, and beyond Immortal
control," the Hierarch sighs. "I fear we are doomed."<BR>It appeared
only a few weeks ago - a swirling gray mass of incalculable size. And
in its center, an eye. A humanoid eye. Now the storm threatens the
very era of Immortal rule.<BR>The growing maelstrom emits a message to
the Hierarchs. But what does it mean? Can it help save this realm of
existence? Is there <i>time</i> to save this realm?<BR><BR>The first
Immortal adventure pits your party against the multiverse in a
desperate struggle to find the essence of life. This adventure is
nothing like you've ever played before.
