The Ierendi princess, Corinna, has disappeared.<BR><BR>She set sail
aboard a ship of the Minrothad Guilds - the guild's ships which have
been pirated and plundered for many weeks. Trade is horribly disrupted
as many ships leave, never to be seen again.<BR>The guild masters now
call for adventurers of great skill and renown. They offer small
fortunes to any who can help them discover who is pirating their ships.
But most importantly, to any who can rescue the princess.<BR><BR>Can
you and your party of adventurers defeat the dangers which lurk in the
dark depths of a terrifying sea? Or, will you find a watery grave
within the cold confines of a murky sea floor?<BR><BR>This game
adventure contains special rules for underwater adventuring.
