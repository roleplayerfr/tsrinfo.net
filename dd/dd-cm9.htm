Your cousin Rolph is dead - and while there is cause for sadness, there
is also cause for celebration. As his heir, you were willed his
dominion: Fenhold.<BR>Of course, the Deep Swamp is threatening to
engulf all of your new holding. People are seeing ghosts, disappearing
without reason, and crops are suddenly blighted.<BR>The farmers don't
like the swampdwellers, the swampdwellers don't like the farmers, and
no one likes the halflings. The entire civil service of the dominion
seems to have either worked for the failure of the dominion or
resigned due to actions of the others.<BR>It's going to be a tough task
to make all this shipshape once again, but you're 15th level now.
Isn't it about time you settled down?
