BACKGROUND</center><BR>For three centuries the peasants of the Dwarvish
island of Baylor have feared the raids of the Vampire Queen and her
minions. Sweeping down at night from the palace in the shrowded peaks
of the island, they range ever farther in their search for blood. And
not only blood - the children of dwarf peasants often disappear if
they are so unfortunate as to be out at night. Even the cities are no
longer safe. The most recent victim was the Princess of Baylor,
daughter of King Arman, who was taken in a midnight raid on the capitol
city of Ar Toe within past weeks. King Arman has offered fabulous
riches and land holdings with titles to the person or persons who can
brave the stronghold of the Vampire Queen and return his daughter to
him alive and well. But, in truth, he holds little hope. For even
King Arman, Ruler of Baylor, Defeater of the Ten Orc Tribes, is afraid
in his heart to face the Vampire Queen.
