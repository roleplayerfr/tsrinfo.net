SCEPTER OF TRUTH</i> HAS BEEN STOLEN, AND A CALL HAS GONE OUT FOR A FEW
BRAVE HEROES TO BRING IT HOME</center><BR>In the canyon of Thunder Rift,
in the village of Kleine, goblins have always been a nuisance, but the
natives have dealt with them and continued an otherwise peaceful
existence. Now, a valuable magical item, called the <i>scepter of
truth</i>, has disappeared! The ingenuity of the crime bears the mark
of the goblins' leader, the Master Thief Raven. The <i>scepter</i>
must be recovered, but there is no one in Kleine with the strength and
courage to penetrate Raven's trap-laden hide-out, deep in goblin
territory. A party of stout adventurers might survive the mission, but
they will have to be quick, smart, and especially careful.<BR>This
module has been created especially for the inexperienced Dungeon Master
