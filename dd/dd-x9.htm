What sends you adventuring deep into unknown lands, across dark waters,
around The Savage Coast? Adventure? The sincere desire to help others?
Or greed?<BR>Cartographers Guild members tell of lost cities and
hidden treasures. Sailors tell of menacing beasts and cannibals to the
west. They tell of savages along the shores who use gold nuggets for
fishing weights. They also tell of great mounds of gold that collect
at river mouths.<BR>You must decide the greater lure; the safety of
Slagovich or the glimmer of gold along The Savage Coast.<BR>This
adventure includes a map which expands the D&D game world, and a
special expanded monsters section.
