To arms! To arms! The battle lines are drawn as desert men and inhuman
tribes wait poised to strike on the fertile and rich lands of the east.
The call has gone out through the civilized lands. The armies have
been raised to match the invading foes from the west. Nobles and
peasants have joined swords to greet the foes.<BR><BR>But Fate or
Chance has decreed another role for a small few. No glorious banners
will wave on their march. No squadrons of knights will charge at their
word. Instead, they will fight the war with stealth, secrecy, and
cunning. The risks they will take are great, but the fates of both
armies lie with them.<BR><BR>It begins one night for your party far
from the fighting. Suddenly you are entrusted with the most dangerous
mission of the war.<BR><BR>Can you cross the Sind Desert, occupied now
by enemy armies, to find the Great Pass?<BR><BR>Can you find the one
known only as The Master?<BR><BR>What will you do if you find him?<BR><BR>
So begins your adventure in <b>The Master of the Desert Nomads</b>, the
first module of a two-part adventure that can be concluded in the
exciting <a href="dd-x5.htm"><b>Temple of Death</b></a>
or played entirely on its own. Can your party do what must be done?
