exit of the dungeon and into the vast wilderness beyond. You hold your

sword. New pinnacles of adventure and excitement await you! You are

game, with a minimum amount of preparation, is contained within,
including over 100 new monsters.<BR><BR>The rule booklet is easy to
read and understand, and the rules have been organized into eight
modular sections that can easily be integrated with the D&D Basic rules.
