<b>Evil magic is afoot!</b><BR><BR>On what should be the hottest day of the year,
snow blankets the tiny village of Torlynn. The winter weather wreaks
its havoc week after week, and the people of Torlynn are forced to
abandon their homes. Only a few hardy souls remain in the village, one
being Burgomaster Gustovan.<BR>So far the burgomaster's plans to save
his town have failed, and now he has but one chance left to save his
people. Gustovan seeks the aid of a band of young adventurers. If they
can uncover the force lurking in the ruins of Barrik's Keep and destroy
the cause of the vile curse, all will be well again. If they fail, no
one will be left alive in Torlynn to mourn them.<BR><BR><i>Quest for the
Silver Sword</i> is an introductory module designed for use with the
new Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. A specially desgined Dungeon
Master map makes this module easy to referee - even if you've just

characters of 2nd or 3rd level.<BR>Included in this package are a complete
16-page adventure, 16 new color stand-up figures, and a beautiful full-color
