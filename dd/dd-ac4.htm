"Tell me, teacher - How does one open the <i>cabinet of security</i>?
Of what use is the <i>banner of bravery</i>? And what are the limits
of the <i>sun deck</i>? My books and scrolls tell me nothing about
many of the magical treasures I've heard you mention time and again."<BR>
"No, Paedras, your manuscripts are too general. But since you have
inquired, I will allow you to peruse this, one of my most treasured
volumes - <i>The Book of Marvelous Magic</i>. It will answer your
questions."<BR>And now you, too, can learn the secrets that were
revealed to Phaedras! <i>The Book of Marvelous Magic</i> is the
ultimate sourcebook on magical items and their twists and quirks. Over
500 new magical items are described in detail. An appendix describes
how these items can be used with the AD&D game.
