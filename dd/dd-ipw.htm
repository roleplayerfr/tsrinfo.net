Not long ago, a magical vortex released into the lands of Thunder Rift
a strange and haunted ship from another time and place. A cursed ship,
bad luck for those who saw it.<BR>The party never wanted to see the
ship, much less board it. However, the mystical astrolabe they found
must have had great power - at least enough to send them here. Too bad
it's missing, now. Will the heroes find a way off the haunted ship, or
are they doomed to sail strange seas forever?<BR><BR>Recommended for
four to six characters of third to fifth level<BR>Can be played with or
without a DUNGEON MASTER<BR>Includes: New Magic, Color Poster Map,
Monster Stand-Ups, and an Easy-To-Follow Format<BR>This module can also
be played with the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS 2nd Edition rules.
