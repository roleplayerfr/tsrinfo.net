Centuries ago in the Black Swamp, Castle Kraal was a well-respected keep.
Its warriors defended the folk of Thunder Rift from the marauding bands
of ogres and goblins who swarmed to attack from the Horned Hills.<BR>And
then one day the keep and all of its warriors vanished, never to be seen
again. Now, all these years later, historians are still trying to find
the answers to the disappearance of Castle Kraal, answers which may be
hidden in Kraal's ruins. The heroes are asked to investigate and to try
and solve the mystery.<BR>Be Warned: Not every mystery wishes to be
solved!<BR><BR><center>Recommended for beginning players and DMs<BR>For
