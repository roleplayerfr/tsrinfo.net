Alphatia, the most ancient empire, land of arcane and obscure secrets.
It has grown for centuries and its might now overshadows the cauldron
of civilization. Some say the Alphatians come from elsewhere, but no
one knows for sure.<BR>Beyond the scope of mortals broods an evil
mastermind, still in darkness. Once a betrayed emperor of ancient
Alphatia, now an entity of the Sphere of Entropy, he seeks revenge on
the greatest empire and on the race of man. His plots brought a
deathly fog on all of Norwold. Perhaps it will extend to the soutern
nations.<BR>The matter is grave, so much that lords of the spheres have
now to show their might. For them, it is time for mortals to intervene.
Man defends his cause for him to earn divine favor.<BR>A great armada
has been raised and able commanders must be found. Prove your worth,
and the eternal portals of the sphere may open for you.
