For a long time you have heard legends about the Island of Vacros; when
you were only a child, the stories about evil minotaurs were used to
scare you into behaving. Now you are grown, and you no longer believe
children's stories.<BR><BR>But King Trueon of Cathos is worried: his
daughter Princess Lydora has been kidnapped, and he has found clues
that she has been taken to the ancient and evil island of Vacros. You
have heard rumors that a large and dangerous mazework lies beneath the
surface of the island - a mazework that is guarded by minotaurs. Of
course many rumors are false, but then again...<BR><BR>The <b>Maze of
the Riddling Minotaur</b> is the second in a series of invisible ink
modules: using the invisible ink pen included in this module, you may
play the adventure by yourself. After you have played the solo
version, you have not used up the module: instructions are provided as
to how you may change the solo vversion into an exciting group
adventure!
