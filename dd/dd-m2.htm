Centuries ago, the despotic Alphaks, ruler of Alphatia, was banished to
another world. From his own sphere of entropy he learned to manipulate
men, and now he seeks revenge against the human race.<BR>The volatile
region of Norworld, a perennial battleground between Thyatis and
Alphatia, draws Alphak's attention. The already existing frictions,
small-time political players, and petty vengeances are the sparks
Alphaks will use to ignite a huge war that will destroy mankind.<BR>
This is an adventure of politics and diplomacy, of treachery and
treason. Only courageous and bold action can save Norworld from the
horrors of war and liberate its people from oppression.
