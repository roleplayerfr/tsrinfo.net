You are a guest of the count, one of your allies and the strongest man
in the region. Your sojourn has been pleasant, a nice change after
weeks of battle. Suddenly the courtyard below your window is filled
with the noise of galloping horses. More guests?<BR><BR>You yawn as
you look out. But these people arriving look more like tax collectors
than guests. You decide to give your attention to something more
interesting, like dinner.<BR><BR>Relax while you can, friend, because
these new arrivals are about to lead you to a crimson sailor, a cozy
Tower of Terror, and a river with an aching heart.<BR><BR>Sabre River
includes a complete campaign setting, new NPCs, dungeon and wilderness
encounters, and a mysterious story.
