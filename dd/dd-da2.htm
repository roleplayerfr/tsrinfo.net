Green Death...<BR>That's what old hands call the Great Dismal Swamp.
For centuries, this tangled maze of sluggish watercourses, stagnant
ponds, and festering marshes has defended Blackmoor's southwestern
frontier. Large armies and smaller parties have disappeared altogether
inside its vast, dripping, claustophobic corridors.<BR>Among those who
have dropped from sight in the arboreal hell is young Risa Aleford, one
of Blackmoor's most important leaders. Carried off to the sinister
City of the Frog, she is now being held by the eccentric Monks of the
Swamp. By making the baroness captive, the deranged monks have
seriously weakened Blackmoor at a time when enemies already threaten it
from all sides.<BR>Yet, even as the froggies gloat, the king of
Blackmoor dispatches a small band of bold adventurers to the rescue.
Deep into the Great Dismal Swamp they must go - far from sunlight and
sanity - there to seek and save the captive baroness from the foul
Monks of the Swamp. There to find - the Temple of the Frog.
