New Magic...<BR>That's what the flying egg has. New magic unlike any
ever encountered in Blackmoor. New magic of a type that could give the
fledgling kingdom an important edge in the wars that are brewing on its
borders.<BR>There are only a <i>few</i> minor problems. Like the fact
that the magician who piloted the metal egg to one of Blackmoor's
southern outposts was killed before he could utter a word. And the
fact that Blackmoor's sworn enemies, the monks of the evil and
eccentric Order of the Frog, are also interested in the magic represented
by the egg. And, most important, the fact that the egg came from the
distant and dangerous City of the Gods.<BR>Set amidst the blistered
salt flats of the Valley of the Ancients, the City of the Gods is a
strange and deadly metal metropolis whose powerful guardians do <i>not</i>
welcome intruders. Yet it is to this place of deadly menace that
Blackmoor's leaders now send a daring expedition - to bargain for aid
in the coming wars - or to steal the magic of the gods.
