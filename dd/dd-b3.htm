Not long ago the valley was green and animals ran free through golden
fields of grain. The Princess Argenta ruled over this peaceful land
and the people were secure and happy. Then one day a warrior riding a
white dragon appeared in the skies over the castle and almost overnight
the tiny kingdom fell into ruin. Now only ruins and rumors remain, and
what legends there are tell of a fabulous treasure still buried
somewhere within the Palace of the Silver Princess.<BR><BR>This module
