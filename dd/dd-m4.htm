In an instant, the city of Lighthall vanishes from you very midst! In
its place come five coins of amazing powers - power to transport you to
a realm of fantastic worlds and incredible magic. In tis realms,
islands float in air and vast armies battle at the brink of oblivion.
The return of Lighthall depends on the defeat of one man: the evil
enchanter, Durhan the Conqueror.<BR><BR>Surrounding himself with the
armies of Volde, Durhan musters his strength for the final assault on
Trann. Defeating Durhan insures the preservation of Eloysia. Saving
Lighthall, however, is another story. Lost in the raging core of the
sun, the city balances on the edge of destruction. The rescue of Trann,
its Ruling Wizards, and Lighthall itself all depend upon the powers of
the coins - and the brave adventurers who take the quest upon
themselves.
