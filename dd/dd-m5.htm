As the cream of your crop, your party has been selected to act as
diplomats on the Isle of Dawn at a historic meeting between Thyatis and
Alphatia, timeless rivals. This could herald the dawning of an age of
peace, unknown in this area for years past.<BR>However, things are not
progressing as smoothly as planned. The powers of Entropy, headed by
Alphaks, are out to ensure that this peace treaty is not finalized.
Two of the diplomats are kidnapped - and you are framed!<BR>It's up to
you to prove your innocence. This involves traveling to other
dimensions, meeting vampiric spirits, and playing deadly games with the
Night Spider. Ultimately, you must find and restore the <i>Peaceful
Periapt of Pax</i> to its rightful place.<BR>Let the games begin.
