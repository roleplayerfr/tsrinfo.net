The Well of Souls...<BR>That's what Zugzul bade the Afridhi call the
evil artifact that he had taught them to make. They must call it the
Well of Souls, and they must carry it before them into every battle -
and they would be mighty. Thus said the god of Afridhi, Zugzul the One.<BR>
So the Afridhi did as they were bade. Seeking the volcano called the
Hill of the Hammer in the far Barrens of Karsh, they built in its
heart a great forge. There, as Zugzul had promised, efreet came to
help them make the mighty artifact. There, amid vile, unholy rites,
they bound the souls of men into its very substance, and, as it took
shape, they sharpened their swords for the red-handed work that must
surely follow hard upon its completion.<BR>Many were the men who
guarded the Hill of the Hammer during the days of making - for their
foes in hated Blackmoor would try to unmake that which they had wrought.
Yet, it was not men that would keep the Well of Souls from destruction,
but a prophecy - that the artifact would be unmade only by the hand of
one as yet unborn!
