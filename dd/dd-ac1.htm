<b>The Shady Dragon Inn</b> is a set of pregenerated characters for use
with the <b>DUNGEONS & DRAGONS</b> game. This player's aid comes in two
parts: each character appears first in a section devoted to his or her
character class. They appear again in the second section as members of
a party. As a DM or as a player, you may use either or both sections;
over a hundred characters await you!<BR><BR>Each character has a brief
biography that will help you to create backgrounds for PCs or NPCs as
needed. Also included is a rough physical description, and a list of
items owned by each character.<BR><BR><b>The Shady Dragon Inn</b> also
contains the <b>D&D</b> game statistics for those special characters
who are presented by figures in the D&D and AD&D toy line, a provides a
tavern setting from which players may start adventures or gather party
members.
