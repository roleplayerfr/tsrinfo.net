You're guiding your party through a dense swamp. Suddenly, the jaws of
three large crocodiles snap menacingly. The fighter draws his sword,
and the magic-user prepares to cast a spell. The crocodiles creep
slowly closer.<BR><BR>Time out. You have to find the tables in the
rules.<BR><BR>Resolving combat is just a dice roll away if you have the
D&D Combat Shield. All the tables you need are included on this handy
3-panel screen: monster hit rolls, saving throws, armor class, variable
weapon damage, and several others. Experience tables for each character
class are also given. The Combat Shield also comes with an Expert Game
mini-adventure: "<a href="dd-ac2-a.htm">The Treasure of the Hideous One</a>." The adventure
features a ready-to-use treasure "map" that you may introduce into your
campaign when your players find clues to a lost treasure. Several
interesting "encounters" are thrown in, too, so you'll have plenty of
chances to use the Combat Shield.<BR><BR>Three crocodiles? No problem!<BR><BR><BR>
