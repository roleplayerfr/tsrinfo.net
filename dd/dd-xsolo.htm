<i>KIDNAPPED!</i> The cursed Baron von Hendriks has kidnapped your
betrothed. Now the madman wants as a ransom your Alandah's weight in
unrefined gold! How are you going to pay?<BR><BR>The baron himself
has been kind enough to provide you with that answer: streams of raw
gold gush from a burning mountain somewhere in the Sea of Dread. All
you have to do is find this mysterious mountain.<BR><i>UNFURL THE SAILS!</i>
The open sea awaits you and your crew as you sail from the city harbor.
But beware! The Sea of Dread has more than earned its title over the
centuries.<BR>Can you survive the perils of the sea? Will your crew
mutiny before you reach the Burning Mountain? Or will you have to
throw crewmembers overboard just to make room for the gold? It's all
up to you in the D&D Solo Adventure.<BR>Lathan's Gold is for one player
only, but that one player may choose between several different
characters and quests. The adventure includes city, voyage, and island
encounters, as well as complete solo combat system.
