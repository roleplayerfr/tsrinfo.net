Prime Prime immortals are dying like flies: nasty, violent deaths. The
Hierarchs suspect Entropy, as usual, especially with all the rumors of
demons' involvement. To top it all off, one of the Hierarchs is
missing - Mazikeen.<BR>Your mission as novice Temporals, should you
choose to accept it, is to find Mazikeen, uncover his kidnapper, and
bring him or her to a court of Immortal Justice. This entails much
more than a mere detective job - it also means taking part in the
Immortal Olympics and going plane-hopping with the best (or worst?) of
them.<BR>Should you <i>not</i> accept this mission, the fate of all
Prime Plane immortals rests on <i>your</i> heads. (Well, it rests
there anyway, but this is meant to make you more than a little guilty
about not accepting - after all. you're supposed to be duty-bound and
all that kind of thing, and if you don't do this, then who will? Huh?
Did you ever think about that, Bucko?)
