Risen from graves and musty tombs, foul, unliving denizens crowd the graveyards
and haunt the ruins of the land within the Mists. Driven by their own insatiable
desires or controlled by the powers of others, zombies, skeletons and others
members of the embodied dead prowl the Dread Realms, looking for unwary victims.<BR>
Now their secrets lie revealed for those with the courage and heart to take up
the tools of the hunt. Continuing the tradition of the <b>Van Richten's
Guides,</b> this volume examines the psychology and physiology of Ravenloft's
unliving denizens. Within these pages, you will find descriptions of their
special powers and vulnerabilities, the effectiveness of certain spells on
them, and ways to neutralize, destroy or command them. Included are new
variations of creatures and section for DMs with suggestions for games that
focus on the unfortunate creatures that were once living beings.
