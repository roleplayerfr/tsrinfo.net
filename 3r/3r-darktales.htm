<center><b>Beware the Tales Told in Darkness</b></center><BR>Childhood
legends, ghost stories and cautionary tales take on a life of their own
when surrounded by the Mists of Ravenloft. From the immortal creature
destined to eternal wandering to the sinister tailor known as the
Scissorman, from the family whose members all have dark secrets to a wedding
night shattered by horror and the house the relives the atrocity at its
core, five stories of classic terror become a setting for bold adventurers -
or helpless victims.<BR>This book revisits the old-fashioned horror story
as viewed through the lens of <b>Ravenloft</b> and provides players and
DMs with a chance to rewrite a horrific ending, or become part of the
recurring nightmare. Techniques for turning stories into games and
adapting a tale to suit a particular group offer a handbook for creating -
and playing - one-of-a-kind adventures that touch upon heroes' deepest
fears.<BR><BR><center><b>Requires the use of the Dungeons & Dragons
