<center><b>IMPERIAL<BR>INTRIGUE!</b><BR><BR>Once a great people in the
Known World, the Mile-<BR>nians now administer a mighty Empire in the
Hollow<BR>World. Loosely inspired by classical Greece, this is a
nation<BR>of philosophers, oracles, architects, and mighty pikemen in<BR>
a strange land where Citizens elect their own leaders, and ulti-<BR>
mately the Emperor himself.<BR>A society as political as Milenia
cannot avoid intrigue, and the<BR>land is rife with conspiracies. From
the would-be Kings to the lowly<BR>slaves, to the dark, grasping
servants of chaos. It seems <i>everyone</i> in<BR>Milenia belongs to
one secret society or another.<BR>But even on the surface, there's
plenty of drama: from the legendary<BR>Acropolis to the eccentric
Academy of the Arcane Corisa, adventure<BR>calls you to the Milenian
Empire!<BR><BR>The <a href="hw-box.htm">HOLLOW WORLD
Boxed Set</a> is required for use with this accessory.<BR><BR>This
product includes a 32-page <i>Adventurer's Guide</i>, a 64-page<BR><i>
Campaign Book</i>, and a full color poster map of Milenia, complete<BR>
with imperial monuments, colossi, and mysterious temple sites.<BR><BR>
