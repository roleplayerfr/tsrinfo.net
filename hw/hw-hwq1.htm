<center><b>CIVIL WAR</b><BR><i>Unrest. Turmoil. Rebellion. As<BR>
above, so below - the cataclysmic events of the<BR>Wrath of the Immortals</i>
echo throughout the HOLLOW<BR>WORLD setting. The Milenian Empire, with
its classical<BR>Greek culture, has not escaped. Already the streets
are un-<BR>safe, and the omens are getting worse...<BR>The emperor is
dead...long live the emperor! But is the new em-<BR>peror a man of the
people, or a tool in the hands of malevolent<BR>powers? Walk carefully,
for no stranger is safe upon the streets these<BR>days, and adventurers
least of all!<BR>The mood of the capital city is turning ugly. Minions
of the new emperor<BR>look on uncaring, while citizens disappear and
philosophers fall to heedless<BR>mobs. The old emperor's elite guards
are disbanded and scattered. Disorder<BR>reigns, and restless citizens
threaten open revolt.<BR>And yet...a whisper is heard. Civil war can
be averted. An ancient artifact,<BR>the <i>Milenian Scepter</i>, can
rally those who would serve the Empire best. But the<BR><i>Scepter</i>
has been lost for generations, and who can say where it might be?<BR>
The trail leads into the depths of the city, and across a dangerous
wilder-<BR>ness to a forgotten oracle. For the lucky and the bold,
perhaps it will lead<BR>to...<BR>THE MILENIAN SCEPTER<BR>This
