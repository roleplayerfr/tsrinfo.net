<center><b>THE KNOWN<BR>WORLD: IT ISN'T FLAT,<BR>BUT IT IS HOLLOW!</b><BR><BR>
Within the sphere of the Know World is another world,<BR>the Hollow World.
There your characters will meet ancient<BR>Nithians, long disappeared from
the surface world and thought<BR>extinct: Blacklore Elves, living in a
magical valley and served by au-<BR>tomatons - devices that take care of
everything, from serving their food<BR> to trimming their grass: Azcans,
terrifying, war-mongering natives whose<BR>taste for battle extends even
into their favorite game - the loosers always die -<BR>and many more.
Monsters abound as well, from dinosaurs to aurochs.<BR><BR>In the Hollow
World, the sun never sets. Magic works differently than it does<BR>"outside"
- some spells don't work at all. And quite often, getting in is much, much<BR>
easier than getting out.<BR><BR><b>IN THIS BOX YOU WILL FIND:</b><BR><BR>
<ul><li>A 128-page Dungeon Master's Sourcebook, with everything the DM
needs to run an<BR>exciting campaign in the Hollow World. Also in this book
are extensive entries on all<BR>the Immortals represented in the Hollow
World: their interests, their allies, their ene-<BR>mies.</ul><ul><li>A
64-page Player's Book, including how-to's for creating a native Hollow
World<BR>character and ways to bring a Known World character into the
Hollow World. In-<BR>cluded in this are new spells specifically for the
Hollow World!</ul><ul><li>A 32-page Adventure Book, containing several
starter adventures and<BR>entries on the various monsters found in the
Hollow World.</ul><ul><li>Four full-size, full-color map sheets, showing
the Known<BR>World and the Hollow World, and detailing the central, most<BR>
populous areas of the Hollow World.</ul><ul><li>Ways and means to adapt
this material to the<BR>ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS<BR>2nd Edition game!</center>
