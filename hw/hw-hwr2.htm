<center><b>MAGIC<BR>AND<BR>MYSTERY</b><BR><BR>The Nithians have long
been the stuff of legend on the<BR>outer world; they are a little less
mysterious in the Hollow<BR>World. Ruled by powerful pharaohs, said by
some to be Im-<BR>mortals in mortal form, they are the most changeless
of all the<BR>cultures in this realm.<BR>What are the fabled powers of
the Nithian pyramids? Is there still<BR>a relationship between the
Haptans and the Tanagoro tribes? Do the<BR>tales of fabulous floating
chariots drawn by fiery beasts contain more<BR>than a kernel of truth?
The answers to these and many more questions<BR>are contained in these
pages.<BR><BR>The <a href="hw-box.htm">HOLLOW WORLD boxed
set</a> is required for use with this acces-<BR>sory.<BR><BR>This
product includes a 48-page DM's booklet, a 48-page players'<BR>booklet,
and a special four-color, double-sided, poster map of<BR>Nithia.<BR><BR>
Details on new magical items and Nithian character<BR>classes are
presented for use in your campaign.<BR><BR>Look for <a href="hw-hwr1.htm"><i>
