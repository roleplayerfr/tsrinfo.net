<center><b>HEART OF<BR>DARKNESS</b><BR><BR>In the Hollow World, one
civilization above all<BR>others is known as the fiercest, most
dangerous race,<BR>to be avoided as much as possible: the Azcans.<BR>
Are they truly cannibals, given to performing sacrifices<BR>as
entertainment? Is their architecture really some of the<BR>most
extraordinary in all the Hollow World? Is there any truth<BR>to the
rumor that there is some connection between the Azcans<BR>and the outer
world tribes of the Atruaghin Clans? Are there any<BR>pleasant qualities
about this warrior race?<BR><BR>Read the book, and find out for
yourself.<BR><BR>The <a href="hw-box.htm">HOLLOW WORLD
boxed set</a> is required for use with this accessory.<BR><BR>This
product includes a 64-page DM's booklet with a pullout section<BR>
especially for players, a 32-page campaign booklet to get you started<BR>
in an Azcan-centered setting, and a full-color poster map of the Az-<BR>
can lands.<BR><BR><b>Sons of Azca</b> expands and builds on material
presented in<BR>the <b>Blood Brethren</b> trilogy of adventures: <a href="hw-hwa1.htm"><b>
Nightwail</a>,<BR><a href="hw-hwa2.htm">Nightrage</a>,</b>
and <a href="hw-hwa3.htm"><b>Nightstorm</a>.</b><BR><BR>
