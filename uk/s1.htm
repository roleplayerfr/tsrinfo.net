<i>This module was originally used for the Official DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
tournament at <b>Origins I</b>. The author wishes to express his
thanks to Mr. Alan Lucien who was kind enough to submit the ideas for
this dungeon. This version has been revised and updated to conform to
ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. Included herein are background information
for players, including the <b>Legend of the Tomb</b> - as is true of
all TSR DUNGEON MODULES, the location of this area is upon the <b>Map
of the World of Greyhawk</b> (<a href="../gh/gh-folio.htm">WORLD OF GREYHAWK</a> from TSR) - DM notes,
level map and matrix, player character statistics for varying number of
participants, and over two dozen special illustrations to graphically
enhance your players' enjoyment of the adventure, as the drawings are
keyed to various scenes and encounters in the Tomb.<BR><BR><center>If
you enjoy this moudule, be sure to try any of the many other unique
offerings in this line from TSR!</center></i>
