discovered in an overrun border town, long ago forgotten by the elves of
the east. It is a magical key - so obscure that history does not remember
its form or even what it unlocks. But an unseen evil searches tirelessly,
even as the lost knowledge finds its way into the most unlikely hands.<BR><BR>

magical items.<BR><BR>Key of Destiny is the first in a trilogy of epic
DRAGONLANCE adventures published by Sovereign Press.
