<center><b>Create Your Own Legend...</b></center><BR>One twin plots in a
dark tower, mastering the arcane forces of magic and learning the secrets
that will allow him to enter the Portal and challenge the gods themselves.
The other twin hides from personal demons at the bottom of a bottle, not
yet having found the courage and wisdom to become whole. Their legend
will change both the history of Krynn and its future.<BR><BR>The legends
of other heroes stand waiting to be written. Personal journeys, great
quests, and heroic sacrifices all lie ahead. Sometimes it is not the
world that needs to be saved, but a soul. The River of Time not only
provides the chance to find the forgotten history of Krynn, but a chance
to visit the world as it might have been. Discover an Ansalon untouched
by Cataclysm, where the Godpriest reigns supreme; visit a magocracy, a
land in which the Orders of High Sorcery rule through the power of magic;
roam the dragonlands, crushed under the terrible might of the Dark Queen
and her dragon highlords.<BR><BR><i>Legends of the Twins</i> is a resource
for games set in the world of DRAGONLANCE. Inside one will find
information for players, including variant rules for character traits,
new feats, prestige classes. New spells and magic items allow characters
to journey across the River of Time. Dungeon Masters will discover an
amazing wealth of campaign possibilities, including travel to Ansalon's
distant past or many different alternate versions of the world -
available to introduce into a current campaign or as a launching point of
one that is entirely new. All information within this volume is fully
compatible with the revised edition of the d20 System game.<BR><BR><center>
