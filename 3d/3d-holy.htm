<center><b>Written in the Stars...</b></center><BR>The mortal races of
Krynn can see the presence of the gods by simply turning their gaze to the
night sky. There the constellations of the gods of good, evil, and
balance wheel about in silent struggle to influence their children who
live and die on the world below. The gods have blessed the world with
miracles of healing and salvation, but so also have they inflicted war and
terrible cataclysms.<BR><BR>Clerics, holy warriors, and people of strong
belief serve the gods, working to bring about the aims and ends given to
them through prayer and meditation. They wield the divine powers of
true healing and magic, and most will live and die for their cause.
Powerful champions wield holy artifacts, some created by the gods
themselves.<BR><BR>Holy Orders of the Stars is a resource for games set
in the world of DRAGONLANCE. Contained within these pages are resources
for players, including information on the gods and the races of Krynn,
new prestige classes, spells, and magical items. Detailed descriptions
of the churches of all of Krynn's gods are present, including the "lost"
gods, Paladine and Takhisis. Dungeon Masters will discover resources on
the gods and their aims, including their various aspects - ideal for
incorporating divine forces into an ongoing campaign. All information
within this volume is fully compatible with the revised edition of the
d20 System game.<BR><BR><center><b>Cover art by Matt Stawicki</b></center>
