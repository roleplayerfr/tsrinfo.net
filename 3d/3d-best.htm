<center><b>Creatures of Krynn From Across the Ages</b></center><BR>
Creatures great and terrible have ravaged the lands of Ansalon and
beyond throughout the five ages of the world. Some are familiar,
creatures that one might easily encounter should the journey go
into the wild. Others are mysterious, unknown threats that hide in
shadows or behind magical camouflage.<BR><BR>The <i>Bestiary of Krynn</i>
is a resource for games set in the world of DRAGONLANCE. It is a
collection of creatures, ranging from the terrifying fire dragons
of Chaos to the tiny, dagger-like feeders. Contained within these
pages are a mix of foes both old and new, challenges for adventuring
parties of any level. Each entry has descriptions and game
statistics useful to those who plan adventures carefully as well as
those who prefer to think on their feet. All game information is
compatible with the revised edition of the d20 System game.<BR><BR>
How do the nobles of Palanthas feel about a vapor draconian mystic?
Players interested in monstrous characters will find a full range
of options in this volume, while new rules for acceptance in
civilized lands will ensure that life never gets dull for powerful,
nonstandard characters. The rest of the book will make sure that
adventures never gets dull - for anyone!
