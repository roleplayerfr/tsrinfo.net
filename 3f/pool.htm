<center><b>Evil Reigns in the Elven Ruins</b></center><BR>Where elves
once built the shining city of Myth Drannor, demons and devils now
prowl in search of prey. Ancient evil slumbers beneath mossy stones,
waiting for those foolish enough to venture within its grasp. Bold
swordsmen, stealthy rogues, and skillful wizards have all met their
end within the walls of Myth Drannor. But the lure of the city's
magical treasures still draws heroes and villains alike to tempt death -
or worse.<BR><BR>Drawn by the dream of limitless magical power, the
Cult of the Dragon has carved out a secret stronghold in the heart of
the ruins. Using the power of a corrupted pool of radiance, the
Cultists stand poised to attain their goal of subjugating all of
Faerûn.<BR><BR>Unless a group of brave heroes can stop them first....<BR><BR>
This adventure can be played as a stand-alone or as a tie-in with <i>
