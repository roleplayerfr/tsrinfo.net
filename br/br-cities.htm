<center><i>Honor, magic, and the open seas</center><BR>As far as one could see,
ships closed menacingly, and warriors swarmed across enemy decks. Smoke tinted
red by the dying sun shrouded the misty sea. The attacking seamen raised an
unholy clamor, and the stench of flaming pitch stung the eye.<BR><BR>Through it
all, el-Arrasi stood proudly at the helm. When his vessel drew alongside the
Anuirean flagship, he was first to leap to the enemy decks, sword drawn. In the
fight that followed, none could stand against his relentless onslaught. And as
the sun slipped beneath the waves, he palced his scimitar at the admiral’s
throat and forced his yield. El-Arrasi had at last defeated the Anuirean
Empire’s great armada, breaking the Iron Throne’s power over his people.</i><BR><BR>
-Historian Boran el-Dussein, in <i>Victories of el-Arrasi</i><BR><BR>
Ever since throwing off the yoke of Anuirean rule centuries ago, the land
of Khinasi - the Sun Coast of Cerilia - has been a land of promise for bold
adventurers. Here the sea means life, the city-state means power, and the
working of true magic is the most honorable profession of all. The remnants
of the ancient Masetian civilization keep watch over the new culture grown up
in its place. The land’s many monster lords, called awnsheghlien, keep watch
too - with a more sinister purpose in mind.<BR><BR>This expansion to the
Birthright campaign setting contains:<BR><BR><ul><li>New rules for war and trade
at sea!<li>Portraits of each domain in Khinasi including complete naval
