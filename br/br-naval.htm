<i>Otto van Riede, captain of the </i>Brechlen<i>, fixed his gaze on the
pirate cog that fled before him. He'd combed the Krakennauricht for a
week, searching for the </i>Icedrake<i>, and now he intended to run her
to ground. His lookouts had sighted the cog an hour after sunrise,
beating her way into the bitter north winds. Van Riede had immediately
turned in pursuit. Now the cog was only three or four cable lengths
ahead and quickly racing into dangerous shallows.<BR><BR>Van Rided
smiled; the pirate vessel would have to turn and fight or run herself
aground. "Sound general quarters," he ordered. "Archers to their
stations! Clear the catapults! And ready a boarding party!" As his
officers and crew clattered to their stations, readying the </i>Brechlen<i>
for a fight, van Riede folded his arms and nodded. "Keep an eye on her,
helm. She'll be turning any moment now...."</i><BR><BR>Every land in
Cerilia depends on the sea for military strength and trade. Many times,
the quality of a regent's fleet and the naval power at his command
prove the deciding factors in his success or failure as a ruler.<BR><BR>
This supplement expands the BIRTHRIGHT domain and War Card rules to
handle sea travel and combat. Players can use the sample navies
included for Anuirean, Khinasi, and Rjurik kingdoms as guidelines to
tailor fleets to meet the needs of their own domains. Special maps
illustrating the maritime areas surrounding Cerilia make it easy to add
a naval dimension to any campaign.<BR><BR>The BIRTHRIGHT <i>Naval
Battle Rules</i> contain:<BR><BR><i>The Seas of Cerilia</i>, 16-page
book detailing the rules for naval battles in the BIRTHRIGHT game,
including sea movement, ship types, naval armament, sea trade routes,
and battles on the water.<BR><BR>A set of 51 naval War Cards featuring
game statistics for the vessels of all the lands of Cerilia, as well as
special wind cards governing movement at sea, and cards describing
naval war magic.<BR><BR>Counters for indicating crew capacity and ship
movement rate.<BR><BR>A full-color, poster-sized naval battle mat for
ship-to-ship combat.<BR><BR><i>These naval battle rules first appeared
in the </i><a href="br-cities.htm">Cities of the Sun<i></a>
campaign expansion. If you already own that product, it is not
necessary to purchase this one.</i><BR><BR><center>Add the excitement
of naval combat to every BIRTHRIGHT campaign!<BR><BR>Suitable for all
levels of play.</center>
