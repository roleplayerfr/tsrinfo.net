<b>T</b>he Sword and Crown is an event unrivaled in Anuirean politics. Every
five years, rulers come from across the land to renew friendships,
cement alliances, and provoke their enemies with poisoned words and
sharpened swords. Wheels turn within wheels, and plots abound. It's
politics as usual in Anuire.<BR><BR>Except this conclave is different.
Not only is it taking place in the PCs' kingdom, but before the
festivities can even commence, someone wages an attack on Prince Avan
and kidnaps his daughter. And to whom do the regents turn to rescue
the princess? The hosts, of course! The PCs must win their way past
dangerous bandits and treahcerous elves and discover a path through
darkest caverns where the slightest misstep mean death. Only then does
the <i>real</i> threat become apparent!<BR><BR>This adventure contains
a 64-page book crammed with details about the setting, the situation,
and the major characters, plus a full-color mapsheet. It is designed
for use with the <a href="br-box.htm">BIRTHRIGHT boxed set.</a>
