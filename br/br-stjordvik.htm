Stjordvik is a domain teetering on the brink of economic collapse, but
rich in resources that could inject fresh life into the royal treasury.
The land is politically fragmented by provincial jarls who go their
own way rather than heed their king, but at the same time populated by
freemen who disdain those petty power-seekers. For centuries the Great
Oak Wall along the northern and western borders of Stjordvik has kept
the orogs of the Blood Skull Barony and the barbarians of Rjuvik at
bay, but now the barrier is near collapse in many places - and if it
goes down, so does Stjordvik.<BR><BR>As the new ruler of this old and
proud kingdom of warriors, it is your job to suppress the other jarls
and unite the provinces; to build up the army and the treasury by
drawing upon the support of the freemen; and to shore up the weak spots
in the Great Oak Wall before a horde of invaders can destroy everything
you have worked for. Your fate and the fate of Stjordvik are
intertwined - what will that fate be?<BR><BR>This BIRTHRIGHT sourcebook,
the second product covering one of the domains in the Rjurik Highlands,
is desgined for players who want to take the role of the King of
Stjordvik. It may also be used by players portraying nobles, vassals
of the regent, freemen, or adventurers from this domain.
