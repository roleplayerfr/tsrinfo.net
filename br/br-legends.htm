Far in the future, bards sing tales of kings and conquerors from ages
past - but from your present. The Hero-Kings of legend are <i>your</i>
player characters from <i>your</i> campaign, who even now shape the
course of Cerilian history.<BR><BR>More than simply an adventure
collection, this 160-page book enables you, the Dungeon Master, to turn
ordinary domain actions into oppurtunites for heroic exploits. Each of
the eleven "legends" set forth here is based on a different random
event from the BIRTHRIGHT <i>Rulebook</i>. Don't allow a mere die roll
to decide the outcome of a blood challenge, rebellion, intrigue, or
magical event - make the PCs forge their own destinies by confronting a
madman who is "Blood Hungry," wresting the "Fang of Kriesha" from its
evil wielder's grasp, thwarting a rival regent's "Double Dealing," and
saving all of Cerilia from "The Gift of Azrai."<BR><BR>These adventures
are suitable for PCs of all levels and classes - wheter regents, scions,
or commoners - and can take place wherever you campaign is set. This
book also includes an appendix that offers advice for running different
types of BIRTHRIGHT campaigns and creating your own adventures fit for
a king.
