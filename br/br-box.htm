A king stands in the high turret of his castle, squinting at the
distant hills. He can just make out the figures of his troops engaging
the enemy in battle. As a damp breeze whips at his cloak, he comtemplates
the war. He has culled the best generals, captains, and troops from
his land. His court wizard wields powers that unnerve even the most
seasoned warriors. Can the forces he commands hold the enemy at bay?
Or will the king awake at dawn to the pounding of battering rams and
showers of deadly arrows?<BR><BR>From the tower, the battle is impossible
to judge. The ruler twists the royal signet ring on his finger
nervously. Then, a ragged messenger races up the stair behind him,
clutching a stained parchment. "Word from the general, your majesty,"
he pants. The king takes the message in trembling fingers and slowly
reads....<BR><BR>Experience the thrill of playing rulers of legend who
command mighty armies and wield the power of kingdoms! The BIRTHRIGHT
campaign setting for the AD&D game makes this possible as never before.
Role-play warriors, wizards, priests, and thieves descended from royal
bloodlines, command imperial powers, and control the destinies of

powerful, as well as millennia-old monstrous abominations that will
