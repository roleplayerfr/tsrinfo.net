Untamed by the laws of man, the Giantdowns region remains a buffer zone
between the ruined empire of Anuire and its northern neighbor, the
Rjurik Highlands. The Great Downs themselves are the stuff of legends:
Giants, they say, are buried beneath the mounds, awaiting some call to
rise and battle once more.<BR><BR>But in the meantime, other forces
threaten the Downs. A new awnshegh, the humanoid known as Ghuralli,
strives to make his small kingdom a rival to the neighboring Gorgon's
Crown. His armies of humanoids, giant-kin, and monsters stand ready
to strike at the few human settlers brave enough to live in the shadow
of the Great Downs.<BR><BR>The Rjurik settlers need a leader, someone
who can defeat Ghuralli and forge a kingdom out of their scattered
clans. They need someone to step forth and become King of the
Giantdowns.<BR><BR>This 64-page adventure accessory contains detailed
information on the Giantdowns region, the people, monsters, and places
that can be found within, and several adventures for beginning and
experience players alike.
