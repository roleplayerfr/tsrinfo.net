The many-headed Hydra slithers in the Harrowmarsh on your western
border. The Sphinx prowls its blasted lands, breathing a venomous wind
upon the lush savannah. The Harpy's birds of prey circle in coastal
salt breezes, raiding laden ships. It seems as if Binsada, your land of
simple, nomadic cattle herders, is hemmed in by monstrous enemies on
all sides.<BR><BR>Binsada is a realm where honor means more than wealth.
The ruler of this domain must maintain the status of the royal family
while not offending those from other highly placed lineages. Foremost
in the regent's thoughts must be retaining the loyalty of her first
lieutenant, Vorduine, and controlling the ambitions of her cousin,
Prince Daoud - without his knowledge, of course. This regent must have
a cunning mind, a flair for the dramatic, and an honorable heart.<BR><BR>
This BIRTHRIGHT domain sourcebook is designed for players who wish to
take the role of the queen of Binsada. It may also be used by players
portraying nobles, vassals of the regent, or adventurers from this
domain.
