Welcome to Endier, one of the smallest domains in Anuire. Carved from
the tracherous forest known as Spiderfell, it is precariously balanced
between three of the more powerful realms of the land, playing a
delicate game of politics and diplomacy to survive. One misstep could
mean its ruin; the fate of the land rests squarely on the shoulders of
you, its regent. It is said that with great risks come great rewards.
If this is so, then the rewards of ruling Endier must be great indeed.<BR><BR>
This package includes:<BR><BR>A full-color, eight-page foldout cover
containing detailed maps of the domain and important locations within
it.<BR><BR>Facts about the history, geography, and economy of Endier.<BR><BR>
A summary of how the government works, and how the regent manages to
keep control of it.<BR><BR>Descriptions of the major NPCs in Endier,
friend and foe alike.<BR><BR>Rumors to keep the regent on the alert,
and royal secrets to help keep enemies at bay.<BR><BR>This BIRTHRIGHT
domain sourcebook is designed for players who wan to take the role of
the Lord of Endier, the thief regent of the realm. It may also be
used by players playing nobles, servants to the regent, or adventurers
of Endier.
