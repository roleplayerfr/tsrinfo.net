To the casual observer, the realm of Talinie seems a pastoral place full
of hard-working, law-abiding citizens. But those who look beneath the
surface - as a regent must - will see what lies beneath the beauty.<BR>
From the south, a power-hungry archduke has moved troops into two of
Talinie's seven provinces, supposedly as a safeguard against goblin
invasion. From the north, greedy guildmasters have encroached upon
Talinie's lush forests and have ravaged large areas for the timber and
ores they yield.<BR>To keep yourself on the throne known as the Oak
Seat, you must control these foreign interests without giving them
reason to rise up against you, and at the same time beware of traitors
within your own court - it is whispered that the death of your
predecessor was not really an accident.<BR><BR>This package includes:<BR><BR>
A full-color, eight page foldout cover containing detailed maps of the
domain and other information every Talinien needs.<BR>Facts about the
realm's history, geography, economy, and laws.<BR>Descriptions of the
major NPCs in Talinie, friend and foe alike.<BR>Secrets and strategy
tips to help the new regent manage the realm.<BR><BR>This BIRTHRIGHT
domain sourcebook is designed for players who want to take the role of
Thane of the realm, playing either a lawful priest or a paladin.
Players of nonregent characters who live in or come from Talinie will
also find this sourcebook useful.
