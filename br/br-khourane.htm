Khourane stands out among the arid Khinasi lands like a blooming lily
in a barren field. It boasts some of the most enviable territory in
this corner of the world: mountains, deep jungles, and a stunning
coastline.<BR><BR>These enivable feature inevitably lead to conflict,
however: The lands are coveted by the Serpent, the Magician, and the
Minotaur. What's more, the elves still resent the humans who claim
control of the hereditary forests.<BR><BR>Combine these problems with
fierce trade wars, a harsh climate, and a missing ruler, and the result
is trouble. Khourane needs a new regent in a hurry - is your character
ready to face the challenges? The new ruler of this domain will be
challenged by some of the greatest problems - and could realize some of
the finest rewards - in all of Cerilia!<BR><BR>This BIRTHRIGHT domain
sourcebook is designed for players who wish to take the role of the
Emir of Khourane. It may also be used by players seeking to play
nobles, servants of the regent, or adventurers from Khourane.
