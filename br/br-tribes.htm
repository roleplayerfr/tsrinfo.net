<center><i>The threat of death lurks everywhere</center><BR>Dmitri lost
sight of his quarry in the gathering darkness and stumbled back from the
carnage. Minutes ago, he and his comrades had been trudging homeward
across the snowfield when, without warning, their guide plunged beneath
the snow in a spray of slush and blood. By the time the ice borer
attacks subsided, only Dmitri was left, himself beaten and bloodied
from trying to save his friends.<BR><BR>The warrior broke into a run,
aiming for a small stand of pines. Winter wolves howled a greeting to
the night and sniffed the cold air. As Dmitri neared the trees, he
could feel the snow beneath his feet softening with each step....</i><BR><BR>
Vosgaard remains one of the truly unconquered, untamed regions of Cerilia.
In the frozen landscape of the heartless north, only the hardiest will
survive - and few of those will thrive. Would-be rulers face the
double threat of Vosgaard's climate and its denizens, each dangerous
on its own and deadly in tandem, neither willing to be conquered.<BR><BR>
Even those who venture into the wastes only for adventure must step
lightly. The snow-choked lands keep an icy grip on their secrets and
their victims. Some say that only Belinik and Kriesha can hear the
pleas of their faithful above the winter winds, leaving the region
truly godforsaken.<BR><BR>This expansion to the BIRTHRIGHT campaign
setting includes:<BR><BR><i>DM's Guidebook</i> - 64 pages of realm and
adventure information for Dungeon Masters.<BR><i>Player's Chronicle</i> -
A 32-page booklet of history and domain details crucial to player
character hero-kings.<BR>New war cards for Vos, elf, and humanoid units.<BR>
A full-color map of Vosgaard.
