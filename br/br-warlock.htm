High in the Stonecrown Mountains, a new source of dark magic stirs,
wakes, and spreads its wings to shroud the land in shadows. The Warlock
of the Stonecrowns, an awnshegh regent who is as evil as he is powerful,
is draining other regents' sources of magical power, choking their
ability to cast the most powerful form of magic of all - realm magic!<BR><BR>
If that isn't enough, the Warlock threatens to close the only pass
connecting the trade-kingdom of Cariele to the rest of Anuire. An army
of orogs and ogres is gathering to the Warlock's banner: Are your heroes
equal to the challenge of the twisted magic of the Warlock of the
Stonecrowns?<BR><BR>This open-ended, "adjustable" BIRTHRIGHT adventure
is suitable for use with either mid-level (4-6) or high-level (7-10)
player characters. You must have a copy of the AD&D game rules and the
<a href="br-box.htm">BIRTHRIGHT campaign setting</a> to
play.
