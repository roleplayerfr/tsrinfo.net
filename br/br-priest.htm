Priests are more than mere physicians tending the wounded and healing the
sick - they are defenders of the realm, champions of their god, and the
politicians of Cerilia. Wheter they are ministering aid, performing
diplomacy, inspiring the people, or dispersing undead legions of evil,
priests command great power and authority. For the power of the Blood
comes from the gods, and only their priests can make a king!<BR><BR><i>
The Book of Priestcraft</i> describes the devoted followers of the gods
of Cerilia, their philosophies, tactics, and daily duties. It also
details new battle and realm spells for priests, and examines the legend
of Cerilian religious relics. This book further explores the <i>
investiture ceremony</i> - the mysterious transfer of blood power from
ruler to heir. And it contains advice to priest regents on diplomacy,
ruling domains, waging wars, and beginning crusades. It's everything
a priest must know to build an empire in Cerilia - or even to survive.<BR><BR>
Come, don the robes of the true kingmakers of Cerilia!
