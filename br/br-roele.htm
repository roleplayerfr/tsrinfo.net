On the border between Anuire and the land of Khinasi, the Three Brother
Mages fight an ancient and immortal awnshegh, the Chimera. The game of
cat and mouse has recently begun to draw regents from the entire region.
Rumors say that the blade of the last Amuirean emperor, the <i>Sword of
Roele</i>, has been tracked to the Chimera's domain, the Chimaeron.
The fact that the Gorgon's armies are mustering in Kiergard seems to
support the rumor.<BR><BR>But choosing sides between the Chimera and
the Three Brothers is no easy matter. If the Chimera drives the
Brothers out, the trade routes through the Chimaeron may be sealed,
leaving the seas free for the Khinasi to monopolize trade. If the
Brothers are drive the Chimera from the magical sources that give her
strength, they may establish a beachhead for the Khinasi traders, who
are slowly gobbling up the lands of Anuire just as their own lands were
once annexed by the empire long ago.<BR><BR>Who will you and your
comrades ally yourselves with? Who is the true enemy? Can you recover
the <i>Sword of Roele</i> before anyone else does, and lay claim to the
Iron Throne?<BR><BR>This BIRTHRIGHT adventure is suitable for use with
any party of three to six characters of levels 5-8, including at least
one regent. You must have a copy of the AD&D game rules, the <a href="br-box.htm">
BIRTHRIGHT campaign setting</a>, and the <a href="br-cities.htm"><i>
Cities of the Sun</i></a> campaign expansion to play.
