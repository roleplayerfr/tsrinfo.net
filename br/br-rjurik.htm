<i>The winter wind screamed mercilessly outside the tribal longhouse.
Inside, the clan huddled comfortably around a blazing fire and heard
the heroic legends of the skalds. "On a night worse than this," began
the woman's tale, "our ancestors defeated the ice giant Gruumvok. The
creature had already devoured their herds, smashed their village, and
crippled some of their best warriors. But through their Rjurik cunning,
the villagers tricked Gruumvok and sent him to his death. Gather close
and learn from the wisdom of out ancestors...."</i><BR><BR>Sprawling
endlessly beyond the northern borders of Anuire, the Rjurik Highlands
harbor undiscovered wonders, secrets, and dangers. Tracts of untouched
mountains and forests offer breathtaking vistas; riches in the form of
trade goods and untapped magical sources lie quietly for those brave
enough to seize control of them; extreme weather and hostile humanoids
await their chance to test any who might venture into these pristine
lands. The frozen north offers challenges and prizes beyond compare -
but only the most ambitious and stalwart will persevere!<BR><BR>This
expansion to the BIRTHRIGHT campaign setting contains:<BR><BR><i>The
Rjurik Highlands</i> - A 96-page book covering the history, geography,
political alliances, major characters, and tribes of the northern
regions.<BR><BR>A full-color poster map of the Rjurik Highlands.<BR><BR>
110 War Cards of new Rjurik and humanoid armies.<BR><BR>Six cardsheets
of major Rjurik cities and player aids.
