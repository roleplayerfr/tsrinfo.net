On the shore of the Sea of the Golden Sun lies Ariya, the oldest city
in all Cerilia. The City of Temples and its surrounding provinces form
the jewel of Khinasi history, learning, and culture. From this land of
ancient magic emerged the Great King el-Arrasi, who brought glory to
Ariya seven centuries ago.<BR><BR>Now Ariya's citizens turn to you,
their newly crowned lord-prince, to restore the city-state to its
former eminence. Tested by war-hungry neighbors, relgious zealots, and
a shrinking treasury, Ariya's ruler must champion light and reason if
he is to guide the realm into a new Golden Age.<BR><BR>This package,
the first Khinasi domain sourcebook for players in the BIRTHRIGHT
campaign setting includes:<BR><BR>A full-color, eight-page foldout cover
containing detailed maps of the state and its holdings.<BR><BR>The
story of Ariya's pivotal role in Cerilian history.<BR><BR>Facts about
the state's geography, holdings, and economics.<BR><BR>Information
about the Khinasi people, lands, and culture that supplements the <i>
Atlas of Cerilia</i> in the <a href="br-box.htm">
BIRTHRIGHT boxed set</a>.<BR><BR>Descriptions of important Ariyan
citizens.<BR><BR>Secrets and strategy tips to help the new prince keep
his seat on the Thousand Jewel Throne.<BR><BR>This sourcebook is designed
for players who want to take the role of Ariya's regent - a paladin or
lawful good priest. Players of nonregent characters who live in or come
from Ariya will also find this book useful.
