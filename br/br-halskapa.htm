From the fishing villages of Fing Zjulor to the druidic city of Odemark
and the great capital of Skapa Hjarring, this is Halskapa, the
greatest kingdom of the Rjurik Highlands in the BIRTHRIGHT campaign
setting.<BR><BR>King Bervinig, aged and ailing, a man who once united
the discordant provinces of Halskapa, is abdicating his throne in favor
of your character. Once, he could take almost any action and keep the
support of the jarls who govern these provinces. Now, his mind
debilitated and his strength ebbing, anything he does creates open
conflict with them - and they are particularly outraged that he has
designated someone from outsidet the group as his successor. Will the
ambitious, competitive jarls allow the crown's choice to stand? Will
they allow the new regent to live?<BR><BR>Halskapa, the original
settlement of the Rjurik in the Highlands, with a long and proud
history as a bulwark of human civilization in the north, is about to
plunge into civil war - unless you can tame the jarls, stop the internal
feuds, and prevent invasion by those who view the regent as weak and
Halskapa as prey.<BR><BR>This BIRTHRIGHT domain sourcebook is designed
for players who wish to take the role of the High Jarl of Halskapa. It
can also be used by players taking the roles of provincial jarls, vassals
of the regent, merchants, or adventurers in this Norselike domain.
