Long before humans invaded Cerilia, the dwarves of the land had carved
out a peaceful life for themselves, marred only by the persistent
savagery of orog tribes. Since the human incursion, life has changed
little for the natives of Baruk-Azhik, sequestered safely beneath the
inhospitable mountains known as the Iron Peaks.<BR><BR>Baruk-Azhik is a
domain of untold riches; there seems to be no end to the precious metals
under the mountains, and surface-dwellers are always eager to trade.
But the domain is not without perils. The orogs have grown more
numerous and more cunning, and outside help may be needed to defeat
them once and for all.<BR><BR>The character who ascends the throne of
Baruk-Azhik assumes command of a mighty and loyal nation - but one
whose existence hangs in the balance. Only a leader with nerves of
steel, harded determination, and superior command skill can guide the
dwarves into a future full of promise and free of war.<BR><BR>This
BIRTHRIGHT domain sourcebook is designed for players who wish to take
the role of the Overthane of Baruk-Azhik. It may also be used by
players playing nobles, vassals of the regent, or adventurers from
this domain.
