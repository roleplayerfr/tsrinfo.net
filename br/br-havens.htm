<i>Sunlight glinted off the chill blue waters of the Krakennauricht.
The lapping of waves against the merchant trader's hull to lull the
roundship's crew into relaxing their attentions, but these sailors were
too seasoned to give their enemy that advantage. Pirates, deep-sea
denizens, and especially the abominable Kraken could decimate an unwary
crew before they could even load a ballista.<BR><BR>A shout from the
crow's nest turned all eyes to the east. "Pirate ship rounding the
isles!" Every sailor hustled to battle stations. But the next cry
chilled the blood of even the oldest mate. "Something in the water to
starboard! Sturgeon...no! A tentacle! Ready ballistas! It's the
Kraken!"</i><BR><BR>Wrapped along the shoreline of the Krakennauricht,
the nations of Brechtür thrive on - and are challenged by - their
relationship with the waters of Cerilia. Undisputed masters of the sea,
the Brechts have carved out a niche as merchants, traders, and seafarers,
avoiding imperialism of the Anuireans and the predations of the
awnsheghlien.<BR><BR>The Brecht ports promise a steady flow of heroes,
villains, goods, information, and oppurtunities. Wheter characters are
looking for adventure, a place to disappear, lands to conquer, or magic
to control, they'll find it here - if pirates, monsters, and
double-crossers don't find them first!<BR><BR>This expansion to the
BIRTHRIGHT campaign setting includes:<BR><BR><i>Havens of the Great Bay</i> -
96 pages of history, geography, political alliances, major characters,
and traders and seafarers of the Krakennauricht.<BR><BR>A full-color
poster map of the realms surrounding the Great Bay.<BR><BR>110 War Cards
of new Brecht, elf, halfling, and humanoid armies.<BR><BR>Six cardsheets
of important Brecht locales and player aids.
