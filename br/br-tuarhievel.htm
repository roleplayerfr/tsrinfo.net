Before the humans descended on Cerilia, the continent was virtually
untouched, inhabited only by those who understood how to live in
harmony with nature. Since the human incursion, however, the natives
have been forced to realign themselves with their homelands and their
neighbors. No group has felt the effects of these maneuverings as much
as the elves, who now engage in a daily struggle to keep a hold on
their lands, fight off human interests, and preserve their heritage.<BR><BR>
In Tuarhievel, matters have recently gotten worse. Prince Fhileraene
has disappeared after being coereced into answering a summons from the
Gorgon - but before he went away, he transferred his bloodline to his
consort, a human female named Savane Mhoried. Many of the elves of
Tuarhievel consider this act to have been a betrayal of their heritage,
even though the interim regent has promised to pass the bloodline to
her yet unborn child as soon as that child comes of age. But in the
meantime, the elven nation is in upheaval. The land needs a strong
leader to prevent traditional values from clashing with the needs of
the nation, lest it be torn apart. Can your character walk the fine
line between tradition and neccessity to unify Tuarhievel?<BR><BR>This
BIRTHRIGHT domain sourcebook is designed for players who wish to take
part in the rulership of Tuarhievel, either as the regent or as the
leader of one of the domain's noble families. This information is
invaluable to anyone who might wish to approach Tuarhievel as a
political ally or embark on adventures in the area.
