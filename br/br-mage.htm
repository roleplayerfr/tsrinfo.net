Magic permeates the very air, earth, and sea of Cerilia - yet escapes the
mastery of all but a rare few. Those who control the continent's
magical energy can call upon forces incomprehensible to the rest of its
inhabitants. These powerful figures are Cerilia's wizards: adventurers,
advisers, and kings whose spells can affect the destinies of thousands.<BR><BR>
This 128-page book contains everything players and Dungeon Masters need
to make wizard characters more distinctive, mysterious, feared, and
true to the BIRTHRIGHT setting. Inside are details on:<BR><BR>The
secrets of sources and ley lines.<BR>Strategies for building and
maintaining a magical domain.<BR>Spells unique to Cerilia, including
new conventional spells, realm spells, and war magic.<BR>Cerilian
magical items and Mount Deismaar artifacts.<BR>The status, philosophy,
and role of wizards in each of Cerilia's spellcasting cultures.<BR>The
unique magician character class and the study of magic in Cerilia.<BR>
Near-mythical creatures said to grant boons to wizards fortunate enough
to encounter them.<BR><BR>Warriors, priests, and rogues beware: The
wizards of Cerilia have come to power!
