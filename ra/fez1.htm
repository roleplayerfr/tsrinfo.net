Wizard of Time Travel, has stumbled upon predictions which will have
a profound impact on his future (whatever that means to a time-travelling

identities. Now, the adventurers must regain their memories and obtain
the items necessary to fulfill the prophecies (while trying not to
disturb the liches' bridge game)!<BR><BR>In this adventure, the Player
