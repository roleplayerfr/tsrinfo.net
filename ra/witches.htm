<center><b><i>F</i></b>or centuries, witches have been a source of fear
and trepidation. Even in this day and age, the imagery of pots of
gruel, bony beckoning fingers, and turning princes into toads brings on
a chilling feeling.<BR><BR><b><i>N</i></b>ow, within the pages of
Mayfair's Witches Sourcebook the witch is brought to life exhibiting
her magical powers. All of the necessary information for including
the witch as a new character class are contained within these pages.
Each of the eight distinct witchcraft traditions: Classical, Dianic,
Golden Dawn (of which the famous occultist Aleister Crowley was a
member), Wiccan, Voodoo Animistic, Elemental, and Deryni (based on the
series of Katherine Kurtz) is outlined in the book. Each of the
witchcraft traditions has its own view of the world and its own
respective culture. The book also encompasses new spells, new magic
items, a sample witch character, and other must-have game-related
information.<BR><BR><b><i>T</i></b>he Witches Sourcebook will
certainly spark player's imaginations and enhance game play in any
fantasy role-playing adventure or campaign.</center>
