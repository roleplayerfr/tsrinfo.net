ganglia clutching dozens of knives with jagged blades. Floating like an

<b>TURN UP THE HEAT...</b><BR><BR>DENIZENS OF VEREKNA contains a monster
folio with more than 50 loose-leaf pages of new monsters from the
demi-plane of Verekna including complete entries for the Marshals, Governors
and Generals of the Prince of Deception and a summary of the various
Thanes and Lieutenants who serve them.<BR><BR>In addition to a veritable
rogues gallery of demon lords, DENIZENS OF VEREKNA features the Grey
Grimoire, a compilation of special spells employed by the most powerful
wizards of the Infernus. These magicks can be used in conjunction with
all of the products in the DEMONS line, making infernal sorcery a force to
reckon with and the creatures who use it more dangerous than ever before.<BR><BR>
DENIZENS OF VEREKNA expands on the material presented in the <a href="demonsx.htm">
DEMONS</a> sourcepack but can also be used as a stand alone supplement for
any campaign.
