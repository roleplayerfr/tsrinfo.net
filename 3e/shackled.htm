SCHEMES ARE AFOOT IN CAULDRON, a metropolis of merchants built into the
caldera of a long-dormant volcano. Driven by the dreams of an insane
demon prince, bizarre cultists known as the Cagewrights scheme from
ancient tunnels beneath the volcano, stoking it once more to terrible
life. To prevent their agenda, your band of adventurers must brave
haunted jungle ruins, slay mighty dragons, and bind themselves to a layer
of the infinite Abyss. Will their swords and spells be enough to save
the Shackled City?<BR><BR>Originally published as 11 linked adventures
