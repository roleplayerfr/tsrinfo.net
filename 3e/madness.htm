aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and other aberrations. The victims of
these alien creatures are quickly overwhelmed by mind-numbing terror - their
only comfort is the hope for a quick death.<BR><BR>This supplement for the
D&D game presents a comprehensive look at some of the most bizarre creatures
ever to invade the world of fantasy roleplaying. Along with information about
the physiology psychology, society, and schemes of these strange beings,
you'll find spells, feats, tactics, and tools commonly employed by those
who hunt them. <i>Lords of Madness: The Book of Aberrations</i> also
