Behind this sturdy four-panel screen, you control all that takes place in
the fantasy realms of your DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. Featuring stunning
new art, this invaluable game aid helps you guard your notes, die rolls,
miniatures, and other surprises from your players' eyes. The new landscape
format makes it easier for you to see the game in front of your screen
while maximizing the space you have behind it.<BR><BR>Also included is a
bonus four-panel screen geared toward the action-packed world of your
d20 MODERN campaign. Because both screens fully support the d20 System,
they can be used seperately or together by an experienced Dungeon Master
or Gamemaster.
