<center><b>Who can stand against the Son of the Dragon?</b><BR><BR>The
Wyrmsmoke Mountains shook with the thunder of ten thousand screaming
hobgoblin soldiers. From the phalanx emerged a single champion. One by
one the tribes fell silent as the warlord rose up, blue scales gleaming
along his shoulders, horns swept back from his head. A hundred bright
yellow banners stood beneath him, each marked with a great red hand. He
stood upon a precipice and raised his arms. "I am Azarr Kul, Son of the
Dragon!" the warlord bellowed. "Hear me! Tomorrow we march to war!"<BR><BR>
Red Hand of Doom is a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure designed to take characters
from the 6th level to the 12th level. Confronted with the relentless
advance of Azurr Kul's horde, the characters must undertake vital missions
to influence the outcome of the war. Can they shatter the armies of the
enemy, or will Azarr Kul's dreams rain destruction upon the human lands?<BR><BR>
