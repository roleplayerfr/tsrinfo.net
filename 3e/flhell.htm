<center><b>VANQUISH EVIL IN THE FIERY DEPTHS</b><BR><BR><i>The tyranny of
the Iron Regent ended the night Castle Ferrule sank into the earth, but the
regent's former minions continue to kidnap villagers from their homesteads,
and an even greater threat stirs below the despot's crumbled fortress. In
the magma-filled caverns beneath the ruins, a sinister obelisk called the
Hellspike holds the secret to one fiend's power over the realm. Can you
thwart the fiend's wicked plans in time?<BR><BR>Hellspike Prison</i> is the
second in the FANTASTIC LOCATIONS series of products. It contains two
beautifully illustrated, double-sided battle maps scaled for DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS play, as well as an encounter booklet. The battle maps feature
fantastic terrain designed to create large, fluid encounters, key scenes,
and exciting game sessions. Rather than simple dungeon encounters, these
maps generate the epic struggles that campaign memories are made of.<BR><BR>
Three of the maps also make ideal battlegrounds for D&D <i>Miniatures Games</i>
play. Build your warband and fight for control of the Mushroom Cavern,
the Magma Ruins, or the dreaded Hellspike Prison. The encounter booklet
includes both roleplaying game encounters and miniatures game options for
use with the four battle maps.<BR><BR>For use with these DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
