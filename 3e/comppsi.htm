<BR>I</b>n ages past, those who wielded psionic power were ignored. Then, as
folk witnessed firsthand their strange abilities, they were scorned and treated
like outcasts. Over time, they have carved niches for themselves in society.
Now you can rub shoulders with them at the local inn, trade with them in the
bustling streets, and follow them on some great adventure. Psionic characters
are everywhere, and your world is all the better for it.<BR><BR>This companion to
<a href="expsi.htm"><i>Expanded Psionics Handbook</i></a> builds
on the existing rules and presents exciting new options for psionic characters
and psionic "dabblers." In addition to clarifying concepts introduced in
<a href="expsi.htm"><i>Expanded Psionics Handbook</i></a>, it
presents three new standard classes - the ardent, the erudite, and the lurk -
plus a host of new prestige classes, feats, spells, magic items, astral
constructs, and organizations.<BR><BR><center>For use with these DUNGEONS &
