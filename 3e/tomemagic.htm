<center><b>Unlock the Magical Power of<BR>Vestiges, Shadows, and Syllables</b><BR><BR>
The <i>Tome of Magic</i> supplement present three new kinds of magic that
you can integrate easily into any DUNGEONS & DRAGONS campaign. These magic
"subsystems" function alongside the existing D&D magic system and offer
new game mechanics, character options, and adventure possibilities. Within
this tome you'll find three new standard classes - one for each new kind of
magic - as well as new spells, feats, prestige classes, monsters, and magic
items tied thematically to each.<BR><BR><b>Pact Magic</b><BR>Powerful
entities known as vestiges exist beyond the boundaries of life, death,
and undeath. The binder uses pact magic - a combination of symbols and
secret rituals - to summon these entities, strike bargains with them, and
gain their formidable and sometimes bizarre supernatural powers.<BR><BR><b>
Shadow Magic</b><BR>The Plane of Shadow is a dark, twisted reflection of
the real world. The shadowcaster, by understanding the fundamental
properties of the plane and unlocking its magical mysteries, learns to
harness and channel its umbral gloom, shaping the darkness to serve her
whim.<BR><BR><b>Truename Magic</b><BR>Every creature has a truename - the
word of its creation. The truenamer knows the primal language of the
universe - the language of Truespeech - and learns the truenames of
creatures and objects to gain control over them, transform them, or
destroy them.<BR><BR>For use with these DUNGEONS & DRAGONS core books<BR>
