<center><b>GREAT HEROES DEMAND LEGENDARY WEAPONS</b></center><BR>Some heroes
find weapons of legacy, while others forge them. Unlike other magic items,
a weapon of legacy gains new abilities as its wielder becomes more powerful.
In the hands of a true hero, a simple sword might achieve fame and power as
great as that of the dark blade <i>Exordius</i>, the wizard-hating <i>Hammer
of Witches</i>, or the skull-shattering morningstar known as <i>Mindsplinter</i>.<BR><BR>
This supplement for the D&D game describes nearly 50 items of legacy. Each
item has its own character, a detailed history, special wielder requirements,
unique powers, and adventure seeds. <i>Weapons of Legacy</i> provides rules
and tools for players and DMs to forge new items of legacy for their
characters or campaigns, along with new legacy feats, spells, a prestige
class, and psionic powers for characters interested in wielding mythic
weapons and other items of power.<BR><BR>
