<center><b>The Ideal Dungeon<BR>Master's Aid</b></center><BR>If your a
Dungeon Master for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, or if you plan to be,
this package is designed just for you.<BR><BR>Inside is a four-panel
cardboard screen filled with table from the <a href="phb.htm"><i>
Player's Handbook</i></a> that you'll want to reference often, plus a
couple of tables created especially for the screen. When you put the
screen up in front of you, players won't be able to see your game notes,
and you can make die rolls without showing everyone else the results.
What players will see is a striking piece of artwork that will put them
in the mood for adventuring.<BR><BR>You also get an eight-page booklet
that includes more tables, plus some diagrams from the <a href="dmg.htm"><i>
Dungeon Master's Guide</i></a>, a Combat Planner form to help you run
combat encounters smoothly, and a page lined with one-inch squares
that you can photocopy and use with miniature figures.
