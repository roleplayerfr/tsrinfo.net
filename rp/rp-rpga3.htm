The High Council of Pellham is floundering. A restless
populace claims nothing has gone right since the last king was deposed,
nearly two centuries ago, and the political situation is turning ugly.
Hope comes from a monastic order, the Brothers of Brie, in the form of
an ancient prophecy. A long-forgotten king will rise in the hour of
Pellham's greatest need and restore order, according to the Brothers.
Can you prove that this is indeed the time for prophecy? Can you
recover the keys to the tomb of the Forgotten King? The prophecy will
not come to pass unless YOU succeed!
<BR>The Forgotten King is the first in a series of four RPGA modules
concerning the Prophecy of Brie. It is an AD&D adventure for 6-10
characters, levels 4-7, that was originally run as a tournament at the
GEN CON XVI Convention. It contains two wilderness adventures, background
information, maps and detailed encounter keys.
