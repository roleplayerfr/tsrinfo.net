Falx, a silver dragon and nephew of old Bahamut himself,
has a problem. He needs a hardy band of adventurers to explore some caverns
near his lair, for the dark powers lurking therein have stolen five potions -
of silver dragon control! Can you penetrate the dangerous complex without
triggering the alarms, to find and destroy all the potions before sundown?<BR>
This is the first of the RPGA series of modules. Each RPGA module
has been used at an official Gen Con tournament and has been designed to
provide maximum entertainment. To the Aid of Falx is usable in campaign
or tournament play, and may be scored by points or using the RPGA Tournament
system. This adventure is designed for a balanced party of 5-8 characters
of levels 5-9, and 6 tournament characters are provided, along with standard
and isometric maps, scenario and character background information, and
detailed encounter descriptions for the DM.
