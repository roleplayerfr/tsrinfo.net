The elvenmaid Rahasia is in dire peril. An outsider,
the evil human Rahib, is trying to force her to come away with him
against her will. To this end, he has taken over the Temple of the
Sacred Black Rock. He has placed the elves who tend it under a
terrible curse, and lured both Rahasia's father and her betrothed into
his hands. You are her last hope. Can you brave the dangers of the
Temple, break the curse, and capture Rahib before he brings ruin upon
all?<BR>This is the first of a line of RPGA modules dealing with
general adventures using TSR game systems. It is a D&D Basic Adventure
for a balanced party of 5-8 characters of levels 1-2. The module
includes background information, maps of the temple complex, a set of
pre-rolled characters, and detailed encounter information for the DM.
