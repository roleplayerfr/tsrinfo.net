Under raging storm clouds, a lone figure stands upon
the ancient walls of Castle Ravenloft. Lightning splits the sky, its
cold light revealing a tall form wrapped in a billowing cape of shadows.
Another flash exposes a face full of power and madness, contorted by a
tragedy darker than the night. Far below, a party of adventurers has
entered his dread domain. He smiles. Another lightning bolt rips
through the night, but the figure is gone. Only a howling wind fills
the midnight air.<BR>The master of Castle Ravenloft is having guests
for dinner - and you're invited!<BR>Originally published in 1985, this
classic adventure for four to eight characters of levels 5 to 7 mixes
elements of gothic horror with AD&D fantasy for a unique experience.
Updated to 2nd Edition, Ravenloft features a haunted castle, gypsy
fortunetellers, a tragic back story, and a vampire who is as powerful
and intelligent as he is frightening - a menace worthy of the bravest
adventuring party!
