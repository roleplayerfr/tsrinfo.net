In the lonely town of Northending, the Council of Five has
called the famous Paladin Athelstan to their aid. The fabulous artifact
known as the Egg of the Phoenix has disappeared. It was stolen by evil beings
and hidden far away - in the Negative Material Plane itself, guarded by a
real Phoenix!<BR>This is the third of the RPGA series of AD&D modules. Each RPGA module
has been used at an official Gen Con tournament, and has been designed to
provide maximum entertainment. The Egg of the Phoenix is usable in campaign
or tournament play (using the unique RPGA Tournament System, included herein),
and is designed for a balanced party of 5-8 characters
of levels 5-9. The original 6 tournament characters are provided, along with detail
and overview maps, scenario and character background information, and
detailed encounter descriptions for the Dungeon Master.
