<center>THE LOST CAVERNS OF TSOJCONTH</center><BR><BR>This is the dungeon
designed specially for the MDG WinterCon V Gamefest Dungeons & Dragons
tournament. It was designed by Gary Gygax and playtested by the TSR
staff.<BR>Use this dungeon for your own tournament or for a new exciting
dungeon for one Dungeonmaster and six players. (Six players aren't
necessary but all characters should be used.)<BR>The dungeon contains
two levels (the Lesser Caverns and the Greater Caverns), each with the
necessary maps, room descriptions, character sheets, monster characteristic
tables, character versus monster hit/damage matrixes, a monster
description sheet, referee notes, and guidelines for the selection of
the best player. Each level takes about 3-4 hours to play.<BR>The six
characters in this situation include:<BR>Cathartic, a 7th level human
cleric<BR>Ethelrede, a human fighter of the 8th level<BR>Flemin, a 6th
level dwarf fighter<BR>Dunil, a hobbit thief of the 9th level<BR>
Weslocke, an elf fighter/magic user. 4th/9th level<BR>Hockerbrecht, a
half-elf fighter/magic user/thief of the 4th/4th/5th level.<BR>Metro
Detroit Gamers (MDG) thanks Gary Gygax for the design of this dungeon

Graaf, John Van De Graaf, Mike Bartnikowski.</b><BR>Additional printings
