Your heroes find themselves on a demi-planar island in the Ethereal
void, where a mysterious god enlists their help in his scheme to stop
Erestem (Takhisis). The heroes must journey through space and time to
recover the powerful <i>cindergems</i> and forge a weapon to destroy
Erestem. If your heroes fail, Erestem's evil minions will invade
Taladas and destroy the Othlorx (Uninvolved) dragons, which is just the
start of her plans for Taladas!<BR><BR>Your PCs must venture into eras
and places hitherto unknown to them. The <i>cindergems</i> are strewn
throughout the multiverse; ancient dragon burial grounds, magical ice
palaces, crypts of restless dead, and much more await the heroes. And
just who <i>is</i> that mysterious god who asks so much of them?<BR><BR>
This AD&D game adventure, set in the vast world of the DRAGONLANCE
saga, is the conclusion to an epic adventure that began with <a href="dl-dla1.htm"><i>
Dragon Dawn</i></a> and continued with <a href="dl-dla2.htm"><i>
Dragon Knight</i></a>. On the previously unknown continent of Taladas,
the heroes must strive to thwart the extraplanar invasion plans of
Erestem, Queen of Evil, also known as Takhisis. Failure means doom for
all of Krynn!<BR><BR>You need the <a href="dl-time.htm"><i>
Time of the Dragon</i></a> boxed set in order to play this adventure.
You need not have played either of the previous modules in this series;
alternate beginnings are provided for players who have not done so.
