<center>* BOOKS * MODULES *</center><BR>The key to victory is at hand
as the Heroes of Legend set out on their final quest!<BR>The port city
of Kalaman seems as tranquil as the morning breeze. Yet on the
horizon the terrible might of the Dragon Empire rushes unchecked,
intent on the city's destruction. Poised now to meet them is the Army
of Whitestone and its vaunted Solamnic Knights. The final conflict is
yet at hand.<BR>Yet hidden knowledge has come to light. The world is
doomed unless a fearless band of heroes can pass through the lands of
the evil empire into its very heart - the City of Neraka and the Temple
of the Queen of Darkness.<BR>Yet there are other forces at work in the
lands of evil, forces unknown to the Dragon Empire and the Whitestone
Council.<BR>The Glitterpalace of Paladine is a fabled place of ancient
times. No one knows where the door is to be found. No one walks its
halls without being changed. Its invitations are subtle, but its
truth is sure...for those who survive.<BR><BR><center>An Adventure for
