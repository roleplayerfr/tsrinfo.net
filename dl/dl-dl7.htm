<center>* BOOKS * MODULES *</center><BR>Far removed from the battlefields
of Ansalon, the island of Ergoth has become a refuge for the Elven
Peoples. Here the haughty Silvanesti of the east, the friendly
Qualinesti of the west, and the wild, native Kagonesti dwell in a
fragile, uneasy peace.<BR>This peace is shattered by the arrival of
your band of adventurers, bearing the shards of the dragonlance and the
power of the Dragon Orb of Icewall. Will the pitfalls of conflicting
elven nations ensnare you? Can you escape across the wilds of Ergoth
to the outpost of the Solamnic Knights, evading the wild elves in your
path? Will you discover the secret of Huma's Tomb and find the final
resting place of the dragonlances of old?<BR>"Dragons of Light" is the
sixth in the series of DRAGONLANCE adventures for use with the
ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game system and continues the Second Book
of the DRAGONLANCE saga. You can play this adventure by itself, or as
part of the grand quest that spans the entire DRAGONLANCE story.<BR><BR><center>
