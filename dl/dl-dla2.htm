Someone or something is killing the Othlorx ("the Uninvolved") dragons
of Taladas. Not only good dragons, but the evil ones as well. Who or
what would be so angered at these dragons as to slaughter them
indiscriminately? To find out, the PCs must masquerade as dragon
hunters and set out to destroy dragons. It's a dangerous game - if the
dragons don't get you, your eployer's might!<BR><BR>This quest will
take the heroes from the alleys of rundown Gridmire through the
entire Southern Steamwall region of Taladas and eventually to the
Astral plane. The poisonous vapors of the Indanalis Sea have wreaked
havoc with the inhabitants of this region, so be prepared to meet
anything!<BR><BR>This AD&D adventure, set in the world of the
DRAGONLANCE saga, is the second of an epic trilogy that begins in the
previously unknown continent of Taladas and ranges out to the Astral
plane. The players assume the roles of dragon hunters to discover the
identity of the "master" behind the plane to wipe out the Othlorx
dragons of Taladas.
