The good dragons of Krynn need help. Recruited by the silver dragon
Saramber, the player characters have joined ranks with the dragons and
sought to solve the mystery behind the deaths of many silver and bronze
dragons. They have performed many services for the dragons and passed
the tests set out for them, earning the trust of these ancient creatures.<BR>
But now, Saramber fears evil dragons have discovered the portal that
could lead them to the dragons' homeland. If this is true, they must
be stopped before they can launch an attack that could destroy this
fabled dimension. The adventure leads player characters from the plains
of Lunitari to the depths of the ocean and the abode of monstrous
Artha, banished daughter of Takhisis.<BR>This third module brings to a
climax the epic tale begun in <a href="dl-dle1.htm">DLE1, <i>
In Search of Dragons</i></a>, and continued in <a href="dl-dle2.htm">
DLE2, <i>Dragon Magic</i></a>. On success or failure hangs the fate of
one of the noblest races of Krynn.
