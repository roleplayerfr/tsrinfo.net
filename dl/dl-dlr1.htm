Beyond Ansalon - beyond even Taladas - cut off from the rest of Krynn
by distance or circumstance, lie several lost lands with enough
excitement and peril to challenge the hardiest adventurer.<BR>Far
beneath the vastness of Krynn's oceans is Watermere, home to the
reclusive Dargonesti sea elves. In their valley on the sea floor, they
work, play, explore, and resist the plots and forces of Takhisis, the
Dark Queen, whose ambitions to conquer Krynn extend even to the seas
and the lands below them. Air-breathers are occasionally brought to
Watermere with the aid of powerful magic - sometimes as guests,
sometimes as pets, sometimes as prey...which will you be?<BR>Silesia is
a jungle island with a spine of forbidding mountains running its length.
Do the gods dwell among the lofty peaks, as the superstitious natives
believe? Or do they just say that because no one who goes to the
mountain ever comes back?<BR>South of Ansalon, past the Ice Wall for
another thousand miles, lies the south pole of Krynn. And there,
warmed by lava flows deep below the surface, is the underground world
of Chorane. Three human tribes, all descended from the same group of
settlers, wage a bitter and never-ending civil war, with evil dwarves
and a long-lost offshoot of the kender race rounding out the balance of
power. Outsiders should pick their allies carefully, lest they
become sacrifices for the great dragons that lair far beneath the pole.<BR>
<i>Otherlands</i> is a 96-page sourcebook detailing three fascinating,
never-seen-before areas on the planet of Krynn, home of the DRAGONLANCE
saga, for the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS 2nd Edition game. A
full-color map of the Otherlands is also included.
