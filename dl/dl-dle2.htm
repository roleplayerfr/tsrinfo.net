The Moons of Krynn are fading. The alignment forces of Good, Evil, and
Neutrality are locked in conflict...and evil seems to be winning! The
unnatural machinations of the treacherous Khardra - daughter of Takhisis
herself! - have led to a crisis of cosmic proportions.<BR>The Heroes
journey to the Cloud City Cirulon, heart of the Good Dragon races,
there to meet the Astral Dragon himself. The nature of a plague
claiming the lives of silver dragonhood is revealed, and the cure is
presented to the companions. But the road to success is fraught with
peril, the only route leading through a secret portal. If this portal
becomes known to the forces of evil, disaster will surely result.<BR>
This AD&D adventure, set in the world of the DRAGONLANCE saga, follows <a href="dl-dle1.htm">
DLE1 - In Search of Dragons</a>. Some burning questions are answered
but more are raised. And as the players investigate, the knowledge
they gain seems to point more and more to a sinister threat of evil
undreamed of since the War of the Lance.
