pierces the cold sky. The chill wind blows snowy swirls across
Solamnic Knights huddled on the battlements. This is their last stand.<BR>
Behind the pass they guard sits the gleaming city of Palanthus. The
war will be lost if the city falls to the Dragonarmy.<BR>All eyes
strain south across the rolling plains of Solamnia. The Knights hear
the distant thunder of a vast horde on the march. An enemy line more
than a thousand strong is sighted moving toward the tower.<BR>The Knights
glance from side to side. Divided by politics and their strict code of
honor, the Knight can only withstand the coming assault if they unite
against the common enemy.<BR>"Dragons of War" is the eighth in the
