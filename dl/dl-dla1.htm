Dragon Dawn. Venture once more to the world of Krynn, but this time to
the continent of Taladas, largely untouched by the War of the Lance.
The dragons here are <i>Othlorx</i>, the Uninvolved, because they
remain neutral in the struggle against the evil of Takhisis and her
minions. Then why are they being systematically exterminated? Who
wants all dragons on Taladas dead?<BR><BR>Your heroes must set on a
dangerous trek in pursuit of dragon killers, through the lands of
hostile holderfolk and to the mysterious Pillars of the Moon. Along
the way they encounter Dragon Knights (warriors with a magic touch!),
ancient guardians, and other surprises in the transformed realm of
Taladas.<BR><BR>This AD&D adventure, set in the world of the
DRAGONLANCE saga, is the first of an epic trilogy beginning in the
previously unknown continent of Taladas and ranging out to the Astral
Plane. Players must track down the dragon killers and warn the
conclave of the Othlorx, but those are only the first steps in
thwarting a dreadful conspiracy aimed at all of Krynn!
