If the Silvanesti are experiencing rebirth, the Kirath are the midwives.<BR>
The time has come for the elves to reclaim their homelands, the lands
warped and ruined by Lorac and the <i>Orb of Dragonkind</i>. The Kirath,
the elite scouts of the Silvanesti, are in the vanguard of the
returning tribes. What they find is familiar, yet unfamiliar -
landscapes twisted by magic, once-verdant lands now gray and barren.
It is the duty of the Kirath to assess the damages done, and report
their findings to the rest of the Silvanesti. Only then can the
tribes return to their woods and fields.<BR>In <i>Tree Lords</i>, you
will find not only an adventure about and for elves, but also
information on a new character class: The Kirath (Silvanesti Scout).
Bring a new dimension to your DRAGONLANCE campaign with this, the
second module in the DLS series. Take part as players in the
reclamation of the Silvanesti homelands! It is not necessary to have
played <a href="dl-dls1.htm">DLS1, <i>New Beginnings</i></a>,
in order to play this stand-alone module.
