At long last, the Kagonesti elves are rising against their Silvanesti
and Qualinesti masters. A prophet has come to deliver them from
bondage; all of Southern Ergoth rings with the sounds of battle!<BR>
The Kagonesti flee their arrogant cousins, heading toward a land of
legend: The Valley of Perfect Silences. Here only Kagonesti are allowed;
no longer will they suffer servitude and wrong. The Gate has been
found and the way is open. Kagonesti pass through the gate and into
the promised land.<BR>Or do they?<BR>All is not as it seems in the
Valley of Perfect Silences. Beneath the idyllic land of the valley
lurks an ancient secret. You must journey to the valley and explore
its darkest recesses. Unless you uncover the mystery of the valley,
the Kagonesti may find that they have entered a new, vastly more
horrible servitude.<BR>Wild Elves contains much new information on
Kagonesti elves and their society. Take your DRAGONLANCE game campaign
to a new dimension with this fourth module in the DLS series. Free the
Kagonesti elves from their shackles and lead them to safety in the
Valley of Perfect Silences. It is not necessary to have played the
three previous DLS adventures in order to play this stand-alone module.
