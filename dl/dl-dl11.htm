<center>* BOOKS * MODULES *</center><BR>Across the world of Krynn, the
armies of light and darkness clash in titanic struggle. Now the vast
forces of the High Solamnic Knights and the Dragon Highlords are yours
to command. "Dragons of Glory" puts you and your players in charge of
all the armies of Krynn.<BR>In excerpts from his war journals, Lord
Gunthar Uth Wistan, Commander of the Solamnic Knights, discusses the
general course of the war and several major battles of the time. Each
battle dicussion ends with the set up and victory conditions that will
enable you to control the course of the War of the Lance.<BR>"Dragons
of Glory" is a complete strategic simulation game requiring no other
rules to play. Yet it is also a valuable tool for the game master as
it can add more excitement to DRAGONLANCE campaigns.<BR>"Dragons of
Glory" includes a huge two-piece, full-color map of the continent of
Ansalon, nearly 400 counters representing both the Whitestone and the
Dragon Highlord forces, a 16-page scenario book with Gunthar's memoirs,
