<i>Est Sularus oth Mithas: My Honor is My Life.</i> For the young men
who have gathered at the High Clerist's Tower, those words mean one
thing: Knight of Solamnia. For some, knighthood is just around the
corner. For others, there will be only failure and the shameful return
home. Whatever the eventual outcome, all of the candidates bear those
words in their hearts. Eagerness and anticipation fill the sun-filled
morning air, as the candidates jockey for position, ready to show
their prowess before the Knights of the Orders. <i>My Honor is My Life.</i>
One Knight, however, does not live by the Oath.<BR><BR>The sword of
Sturm Brightblade is gone, stolen from his dead body. The dishonorable
one must be brought to justice, before he flees forever and the blade
lost. The trail leads through webs of intrigue to traitors and thieves
most foul. This is a task suitable only for those of keen mind and
stout heart, for danger will confront them at every turn.<BR><BR>This is
the first adventure module written for the <a href="dl-tales.htm">
Tales of the Lance Boxed Set</a>, and is especially designed for
beginning players and the DUNGEON MASTER. It reveals for the first
time the powers of the Brightblade, the hereditary sword of Sturm
Brightblade, a Hero of the War of the Lance. Additional background
information is included, along with new magical items and some
pregenerated characters to help get the adventure running quickly and
easily.
