Caramon, Raistlin, Tika, Laurana. Tanis, Sturm, Flint, Tasselhoff...heroes
all, their names are known by everyone familiar with their saga. But
there are others as well: veterans of the War of the Lance, players
behind the scenes, and even those who had no involvement with the War
whatsoever who are still heroes in their own right. Many are presented
here for the first time. Among them:<BR>Grindlethorpe, the first
Krynnish gnome to complete <i>three</i> Lifequests;<BR>Fester, Queen of
the Gully Dwarves of Mudhole, wife to Nomscul, Best Cook, Chief Shaman,
and Queen's First Husband (a much more distinguished title than "King");<BR>
Liliornin, an elven wizard whose first adventure pitted her against a
death knight and an enclave of Wizards of the Black Robe (and
introduced her to her longtime adventuring companion);<BR>and many,
many more.<BR><BR>Each entry is presented in a format akin to the
Monstrous Compendium pages, with statistics, proficiencies and other
pertinent adventuring information, a description, and background
material, among other things. Many entries first appeared in the
ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Trading Cards, and have been expanded for
inclusion in this product.<BR><BR>Add new life to your DRAGONLANCE
campaign with these new characters, the Unsung Heroes!
