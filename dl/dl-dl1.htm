You stand on the road east of Solace, tired from five years of
adventuring, from a fruitless search for lost clerical magic. You know
the old proverb that claims "You must return to find what you left to
seek," but the saying never really made sense. Soon, however, it will.<BR>
For the world of Krynn is not the same: refugees stream out of the
northernmost human lands, telling horrible tales. An invading army has
burned their villages and put their family and friends to the sword.
Among these stories you hear even darker rumors - that older evils, the
dragons themselves, have returned to the world, for new and more
terrible purposes.<BR>"Dragons of Despair" is the first in TSR's new
series of DRAGONLANCE adventures for use with the ADVANCED DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game system. Your players will adventure in the world of Krynn,
visit strange places such as Haven or ruined Xak Tsaroth, and encounter
the bizarre draconians and spectral minions. They can play the modules
as a set of seperate adventures or as a great quest that spans the
entire DRAGONLANCE story.<BR><BR><center>An Adventure for Character
