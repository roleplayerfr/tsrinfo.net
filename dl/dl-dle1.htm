Good, Evil, Neutrality. These three forces exist in a delicate balance,
a balance crucial to the harmony of all things. Now that harmony is
threatened and all of Krynn is in jeopardy.<BR>For reasons unknown, the
balance among Krynn's good, evil, and neutral dragons is shifting: A
deadly affliction is killing off silver dragons, and nobody has seen a
bronze dragon in months. What's more, the people of Krynn seem to have
lost their respect for dragons, hunting them for sport, looting their
treasure troves, even training them for use in circuses and sporting
events! ANd as the adventure begins, a strange being named Khardra
appears with a fascinating theory - that dragons are merely animals
whose presence on Krynn may no longer be necessary!<BR>In this AD&D
adventure set in the world of the DRAGONLANCE saga, players must
discover what is wrong with the good dragons of Krynn. And just who is
Khardra, anyway? As they investigate these mysteries, players learn
many secrets of dragons. How they use their newfound knowledge
determines the fate of their world.
