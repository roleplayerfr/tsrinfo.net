Winter wolves are the terrors of the tundra, perfectly adapted to their
wintry environment. Though wearing the form of a simple animal, the
winter wolf's cunning and intellect approaches that of humankind,
making these creatures far more dangerous than their physical
appearance would indicate.<BR><BR>Built like a common wolf and yet
standing taller than the fiercest dwarven warrior, a winter wolf is
equally at home in the snow-laden wastes of the deep arctic or the
towering heights of jagged, windswept mountains.<BR><BR>During the
heaviest blizzard, when all that can be seen are swirling shades of
white in all directions, the winter wolves prowl for food, heedless of
the ice matting their pelts or the cold winds sweeping across their
lupine faces. When fierce winter storms send sheets of freezing hail
and sleet screaming across the snow-swept plains, and even the
heartiest arctic inhabitants nestle deep into hidden burrows for
warmth and safety, packs of winter wolves range the white wastes,
seeking their prey. Silently they stalk their unknowing quarry,
slipping ghostlike through the snow-filled landscape, their tracks
quickly erased by the howling arctic winds. Discovering a lone victim
struggling through the bleak landscape, they add their own howls of
triumph to the voice of the wind. Hearing this, the victim knows with
dire certainty that all hope is gone, for none can evade these lords of
the cold-lands for long...<BR><BR>Within these pages you will find
detailed information on winter wolf physiology, habitat, and society,
giving you a basic overview on how this race exists and interacts with
the rest of the world. Players can learn winter wolf hunting tactics
and Games Masters are given guidelines on how to introduce winter
wolves into their existing campaigns. They will also benefit from
material demonstrating how to portray winter wolves to the players,
so that they stand out from the normal wolf. The section on foundlings
may make for an interesting NPC (or even Player Character) background.
Finally, a complete winter wolf lair is featured to be used as either
an extended encounter or as an example of how such lairs are generally
laid out.<BR><BR>Written by the author of so many 'Ecology' articles
within Dragon magazine, The Slayer's Guide to Winter Wolves is the
ultimate resource for any player or Games Master daring to adventure
within the cold lands of the north.<BR><BR>Inside You Will Find<BR><BR>

breathing blasts of icy cold wind, they are no ordinary wolf and their

arctic lands.<BR><BR><b>Habitat:</b><BR>The majority of winter wolves
are found in the cold regions of the arctic and subarctic climates.
There they live as wild and free as their smaller brethren, those
unhampered by the burdens of intellect and civilisation. Most winter
wolf packs live a simple life, worried only about their next meal, next
hunt, and next litter. They are the undisputed masters of their wintry
realm, living off the land and looking only to their own abilities for
survival.<BR><BR><b>Winter Wolf Society:</b><BR>Learn about the
dominant nature of winter wolf packs and how they steal young infants
of other intelligent races in order to raise them as foundlings. Also
discover the terrible fate of the runt of each litter.<BR><BR><b>

a pack rather than fight individually, however, their enhanced
intelligence allows them to fight more far effectively on the
battlefield.<BR><BR><b>Role-Playing with Winter Wolves:</b><BR>These
highly intelligent and cunning creatures are no mere canine. Games

befits their stature and make any such encounter memorable in the minds
of his players.<BR><BR><b>Scenario Hooks & Ideas:</b><BR>Several ideas
