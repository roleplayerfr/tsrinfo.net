Not long ago, Alstand was a prosperous town, bustling with activity and
commerce. Now, its streets are quiet and all but empty. Uneasy faces
with hollow eyes peer through cracks in shuttered windows. Animals
grow skittish in the town's narrow streets.<BR><BR>The few passersby
warn that the town's residents are disappearing, one by one. Friends
and neighbors vanish from their homes. The terrified townspeople
whisper of ghastly noises coming from Watchman's Hill. Something is
moving among the grim, dark stones of the old cemetary, which has stood
still for a century.<BR><BR>The adventurers' horses shy away from the
small figure that darts from the darkness of a half-open cottage door,
an unkempt conglomeration of gaunt, dirty face, rumpled, unwashed clothes,
and staring, blood-shot eyes. "Please! Can you help me?" He is a
ten-year old boy, and his terrified gaze flicks in all directions,
looking for danger. "Please! Something has taken my mother and father!"
