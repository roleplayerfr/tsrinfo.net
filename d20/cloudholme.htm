<center><b>Journey to a land lost to time and legend.</b><BR><BR>The mythical
land of Astenthal where once the four races lived in a golden age of peace and
mystical knowledge long passed. Where the very ideals of tolerance, equality
and justice were a shining beacon of harmony. Yet the brightest light casts
the deepest shadows and Astenthal fell, ruined to mist shrouded memory, a dream
of a better world swallowed in a cataclysm of hatred, war and avarice. Legend
speaks of the return of lost Astenthal's king, a good and righteous man who would
reunite the virtues and peoples of the land bringing the dawn of a new age.<BR><BR>
Dare you journey into the lost past where the darkest shadows grow and take a
hand in shaping the destiny of a people who have abandoned the future long
with the outside world? Will you confront the growing darkness that threatens
to engulf Astenthal a second time? In a land of tainted with ancient loss and
pain, can you reunite the people before darkness engulfs them.<BR><BR>In a world
of shadows can you rekindle hope?</center><BR>First in the Legendary Lands
