It's all about hitting things, even the flavor text.<BR><BR>This book provides
a complete weapons-based martial arts system for practically every weapon in
the game and a few things you wouldn't even recognize as weapons (like an
immovable rod). Masters of Arms includes over 300 special maneuvers, spread
across more than 30 classes.<BR><BR>Masters of Arms focuses on unusual weapons
and those who master them. Combination maneuvers give you many different ways
to devastate things and defensive maneuvers give you something to do while the
monsters try to eat you. All the classes are designed with maximum flexibility
and customizability in mind and most of their special abilities can double as
new feats, so that those who don't wish to specialize in a prestige class can
still expand their library of actions. For gamemasters the Alpha Beast
provides a convenient way to upgrade a monster for close in fighting, whether
using claws or teeth or tentacles. And the telekinesis master can make
fighting demons a very different experience.<BR><BR>In addition Masters of
Arms includes a combination maneuver construction system. For those
gamemasters, players, and game designers willing to risk their sanity, the
construction system can work quite nicely but Second World Simulations will not
compensate you for mental anguish or possible psychiatric bills.
