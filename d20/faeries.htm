<i>Welcom to the Twilit Lands...</i><BR><BR>...where all is fey and faeries rule.
<i><b>Faeries</b></i> provides anwers on the fair folk, the fey races and creatures
more ancient than dragons and far more enigmatic than their sizes or shapes ever
reveal. The secrets held by the fey far outstrip all the other races combined,
and this book brings them right to players and Game Masters alike.<BR><BR><i>
Embrace the Magic... beware the Cost!</i><BR><BR>This supplement provides new
rules and a new understanding of fey monsters as well as many new faeries for
your d20 games. Players can learn more skills and spells, plus discover
magical artifacts and secrets from the fey. Meet new monsters and fey legends
that cross many worlds and cultures, from Old Man Winter to the Lady of the
Lake. Best of all, the world of Faerie, a world as close as a dream and as
magical as its denizens, comes alive with its legends and lore. And every
element is presented in a world-neutral format, allowing easy placement into
any fantasy setting.<BR><BR><b><i>Faeries</i></b> require the use of the <b>
