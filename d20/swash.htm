<center><b>From the open seas to the king's palace,<BR>a new brand of
excitement awaits!</b></center>Two hundred years from the world of
high fantasy, a different kind of world exists: where daring musketeers
fight injustice in the name of the king, bold pirates claim riches with
a blast of grapeshot, and matters of honor are settled at the end of a
blade. It is the world of Errol Flynn and Alexandre Dumas, the world
of Captain Blood and the Count of Monte Cristo. It is the world of
swashbuckling... and now, it is open to you.<BR>Learn what it means to
seek hidden treasure, to plot terrible revenge, to protect the
innocent with nothing more than a quick tongue and a quicker sword.
Sail with daring privateers in search of fabulous riches, plunder the
wealthy as a charming highwayman, or thwart dastardly villains as one
of the famous musketeers. From the halls of power where noble
courtiers plot endless intrigue, to the wharfside docks where vicious
sailors will kill you for your boots, it's all waiting between these
covers.<BR>Welcome to Swashbuckling Adventures!<BR><BR><i><ul><li>
