It all started simply enough, just like your last adventure, and perhaps
even the one before that. There you were, in a tavern, when someone
you'd never met before approached you with a promise of great wealth
complicated only by just a little danger.<BR>"Good people, I beseech
you: Hear my story. My name is Allyn, and someone dear to me has
suffered a tremendous attack upon his very soul. He now lies on the
verge of death.<BR>"As a child, I was fascinated by a story of an
enchanted ruby with the power to bring a lost soul back from the dead.
I have traveled far and wide in pursuit of many different and amazing
treasures, but I have only recently discovered that this story may be
true and that the ruby might actually exist.<BR>"You see, many hundreds
of years ago - in the region we now call the Great Desert of Ninva -
there ruled a wicked man named Amun Khonshu. Some say he was a powerful
sorcerer, others say he was a god. In searching for this fabled ruby,
I have found that this region did not become a desert until after this
vile man died. Once his vast power was taken with him into the
afterlife, its horrible absence left a terrible blight upon the land.<BR>
"Regardless of the effects of his disappearance, Amun Khonshu was a
murdered and a tyrant who ruled over the people of these lands by a
fanatical death cult dedicated to his advancement. Fortunately, upon
Amun Khonshu's death, his cult was driven underground and eventually
destroyed by neighboring nations. But before the cult was vanquished,
the servants of Amun Khonshu managed to preserve their leader's body
and seal it away in a secret tomb, along with his vast store of
ill-gotten treasure. Legend has it that they left the enchanted ruby
there as well, to guide his soul back to his mortal frame.<BR>"Good
people, I believe I have found the location of this tomb, but my own
band of associates was sadly not up to the task of surmounting the
perils of the Ninva Desert. I beg you, please help me find the Heart
of Amun Khonshu to save my friend. If you do, all of the treasure of
that tomb, save the ruby, is yours - all of it!<BR>"What say you?"
