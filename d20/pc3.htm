<center>The exorcist is a protector and guardian against the influence of
supernatural creatures upon mortals. He focuses the power of his faith towards
rooting out the monsters that would prey on common folk, toying minds and
bodies with their unholy powers of domination and possession. He is an expert
on rituals that protect people and place from these creatures, and his faith
and conviction allow him to detect the traces of their passing in order to
expel them back from whence they came.
<BR><BR>This is the third book of the Power Classes series from Mongoose
Publishing. Designed to be seamlessly slotted into any fantasy-based d20
system game, each of these mini-supplements introduce an entirely new core
character class, adding a whole new dimension to campaigns. Players will find
full details on how to use the new character class, greatly increasing the
wealth of options they are presented with by the core rulebooks while Games
Masters may revel in the wide variety of new classes they have at their
disposal for non-player characters in their campaigns. Each Power Class
booklet can provide hours of gaming enjoyment at an all new low cost.<BR><BR><b>
