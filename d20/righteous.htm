<center><b>"Speak in my voice, you gods, you lords of Heaven, for it is
your tale I tell!"</b></center><BR><i>"Some men journey to the ends of
the world in the name of Honor. Some men stand alone against a marauding
army with nothing but a sword and a prayer in the name of King and
Country. All I have done, and all I will ever do, is in the name of
Truth. Know this, my reader: What you read is true."</i><BR><BR>So
speaks the Great Sage Matalou, as he welcomes you to the world of
<i>The Book of the Righteous</i>. The Great Tree Eliwyn reaches to
Heaven where the gods watch the toilings of the mortal races, and grant
their powers to those that honor them sufficiently.<BR><BR><i>The Book
of the Righteous</i> is the most comprehensive religious tome the
