<center><b>A Realm of Evil</b><BR><BR>Feuerring, the great Ring of
Fire, encapsulates Hell providing a formidable obstacle to those
seeking passage into its lower layers. Anguished screams and horrific,
ear shattering cries emanate from the multitude of condemned souls
consigned to Feuerring's eternal flames of woe. The tormented spirits
of the damned bob helplessly upon Feuerring's surface, buffeted by the
shifting and treacherous vortices created by their uneasing and
desperate pleas for mercy. Massive islands of sulphurous, smouldering
rock float upon the unquenchable ocean of fire and brimstone.<BR><BR>
Within this sourcebook, you will find an entire layer of Hell ready to
drop straight into your campaign. Feuerring is fully detailed, with
locales and features of each of this layer's realms. In addition,
Games Masters will be able to make ready use of the new creatures that
populate the plane, as well as the spells, magic items and artefacts
that comprise the dark knowledge of Feuerring's denizens. The creatures
of this layer eke out their existence in the hostile confines of
their fortress-prison, eternally watching for outside interference or
for oppurtunities to lauch their own incursions into the rest of the
Universe. Feuerring is the kind of hellish realm featured in many a
myth, where heroes travel to stop the downfall of entire worlds, wrest
the secret to an evil enemy's defeat or rescue the doomed souls of
loved ones. An entire chapter is devoted to help the Games Master
insert Feuerring quickly and easily into their existing campaigns,
with ways of infiltration and escape from its fiery depths, and plot
hooks and scenarios to challenge the hardiest adventurers. One way or
another, few players will ever forget the adventures they endure in a
realm of evil and torment, bringing the only light to be found in its
expanses.<BR><BR>FOR GAMES MASTERS AND PLAYERS ALIKE</center>
