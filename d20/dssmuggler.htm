<center><b>Welcome to the Smuggler's Run</b></center><BR>At the edge of
civilized space or in the shadow of the Dragon Empire itself, the citizens
of the galaxy need food-stuffs, technology, clothing, and contraband. This
is the role of the interstellar free trader, delivering important, secret,
or illegal cargo to the richest spires of the Empire and the deepest pits
of the Outlands.<BR><BR>This book has everything you need to play a smuggler
or free trader in the DRAGONSTAR campaign setting, plus the tools players
and DMs both need to make a privateers campaign fun and easy. New prestige
classes, new feats, new spells, and new starships expand and define the
markets of the Dragon Empire. Simple new rules for commerce, supply, and
demand focus the smuggler's business on its exciting choices and
adventure possibilities. To demonstrate it all, this book describes a new,
remote corner of the DRAGONSTAR universe that's easy to place into any
campaign: the Smuggler's Run.
