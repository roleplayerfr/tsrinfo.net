A year ago, one of the trade caravans into the Northlands failed to
return. No one thought much of it at the time - trade with the
Northlands has always been hazardous. The next two also failed to
return. Now trade with the Northlands has ceased.<BR><BR>Six months
ago, the Brotherhood of Prophecy used its signal mirror to shine a
bright distress call. Immediately border troops were sent deep into
Ardenwood to assist the monks. Two days later, the distress signals
ceased. The guards never returned.<BR><BR>Fearing that the orc and
goblin hordes had overtaken the monastery, the Lord ordered his best
scouts and soldiers to investigate. That was three months ago. They
were never seen again. Additional troops cannot be sent without
leaving Tageth unprotected. Lord Grimlee has offered a reward of
1,000 gold pieces to anyone who can reach the monastery and return
with news of what has happened.
