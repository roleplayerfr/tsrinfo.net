"The first raid on our village happened a little over three months ago.
We awoke in the morning to discover that the Cooper family's house at
the edge of town had been sacked and the entire family was missing,"
croaks Obed, the village elder. "We mounted a search party, but found
no trace of them."<BR>The old man lifts his gaze to the west woods.
"After the third such attack, we sent a messenger to seek aid from one
of the larger towns nearby. He never returned."<BR>He turns back to
face your party and continues, "We had no idea who or what was
attacking out village... until last week. Creatures in black robes
drifted out of the woods to the west and began setting houses on fire.
Then, they seized four of out bravest men and carried them, screamin,
into the mists."<BR>Obed throws his mug of ale into the fire, suddenly
angry, "The only creature capable of this evil is the Barrow King, who
lives in the burial mounds to the west. But I swear, we have done
nothing to focus his anger upon us, nothing!"<BR>Wearily, the elder
stands, leaning heavily on his walking stick. Slowly, he lifts it,
pointing at each of you in turn.<BR>"If it is the Barrow King, God help
us!"
