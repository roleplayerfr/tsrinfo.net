The biggest, meanest, dumbest race in d20 is back for another round. The orc
has long been a punching bag for fantasy gamers, but not anymore! The orcs
(and half-orcs) of <i>Wrath & Rage</i> are stronger, more savage, and more
cunning than anything you've faced before. This toolkit for GMs and players is
packed with new options, including:<BR><BR><ul><li>Over 50 new feats, including
Rage Challenging feats that let you "spend" a rage to create new types of
mayhem.</ul><ul><li>Seven new prestige classes for GMs and players, including
the Rage Smith and the Soul Gorger.</ul><ul><li>4 new creatures and 3 new
templates - allies and servants of the orc tribes.</ul><ul><li>2 sample
orcish pantheons: the Great Warband and the Patrons.</ul><ul><li>9 new domains,
including Savagery and Treachery, and over 20 new spells.</ul><ul><li>New
equipment worthy of a warlord: exotic weapons, magic items, and siege engines.</ul><ul><li>
80 levels worth of NPC stats for Gamemasters on the go.</ul><ul><li>Interior
illustrations by featured artist Toren "MacBin" Atkinson.</ul>Whether you
intend to use orcs against your players, or to play one yourself, <i>Wrath &
Rage</i> guarantees that you'll never look at this ancient race the same way
again.<BR><BR><center><b>WHAT IS OGL INTERLINK?</center><BR>Green Ronin
