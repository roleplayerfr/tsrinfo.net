Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
On the edge of the mysterious Barren Hills, between the mountains and the
Great Desert, there is a gigantic statue of a crowned gynosphinx, ancient
beyond reckoning. At its feet, a great androsphinx known as Khubsheth
the Prophet has dispensed counsel and prophecy to all who come to him for
longer than mortal records can tell. The heroes have come to visit
Khubsheth, whether for counsel, prophecy, or out of curiosity, but as
soon as he lays eyes on them, he attacks! Upon his defeat, he tells
them that they are the heroes foretold by the legend of Ankharet, the
sphinx queen. Ankharet ruled over a long-dead empire of sphinxes, but
she fell into darkness. Her subjects rebelled and cast her down, but
were unable to kill her. It is said that they bound her with great magic
and buried her in a tomb, to wait for the foretold heroes who would be
able to slay her and end her evil forever. Kubsheth the Prophet tells
the heroes that they must enter the tomb of the long-dead sphix queen,
kill her, and destroy her cursed crown, an artifact of tremendously evil
power. As his blood seeps into the sands, a doorway opens at the base of
the statue, leading down into darkness...<BR><BR>

series!
