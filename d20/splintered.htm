<center><b>A CITY TORN ASUNDER ...</b></center><BR>The city of Marchion was a
thriving place, a gateway for trade between civilized and barbarian lands. The
humanoid races lived together; if not in harmony, then at least in peace. But
now orcish raids have devastated trade, and hard times are turning the races
against each other. It's up to a bold group of adventurers to save the city
from itself.<BR><BR><i>Splintered Peace</i> is a political campaign emphasizing
both action and intellect, in which the player characters strive to prevent
racial tensions from tearting their home apart. This city sourcebook is
designed for 8th-level characters with a mix of classes and abilities. It
features:<BR><BR><ul><li>A scenario that takes place over the course of months
of game time, with 10 extra adventure seeds to use before or after the main
adventure, making Marchion a continuing part of your campaign world.</ul><ul><li>
Resource management and attitude rules for adjudicating the reaction of each of
Marchion's races to the PCs, and the effect the characters' actions have on the
tension in the city.</ul><ul><li>Character descriptions for 31 NPCs, including
Marchion's mayor, the town council, prominent citizens, and spokespeople for
the townsfolk.</ul><ul><li>Eight new local gods, including Masshogu, Mother of
All Orcs.</ul><ul><li>A breathtaking two-page map of the city of Marchion,
with detailed descriptions of its important locales and major events over the
course of the campaign.</ul><center>Requires the use of the Dungeons & Dragons
