A mythic artifact known as the Crystal Consciousness cycles toward
awareness... and with its waking, the entire psionic paradigm hangs in
the balance. Many seek to control the Crystal: a psionic lich, a band
of fanatic arcantists, and a guild powerful in the arts of the mind.
Some would use the Crystal to dictate the future of psionics, while
others would use it to crush the mental arts forever. Will you harness
the Crystal's power to safeguard the Six Disciplines - or create your
own new discipline and doom another? In this companion piece to the
popular <a href="../3e/psionics.htm">Psionics Handbook</a>,
player characters find themselves caught up a world-shaking event. In
addition, fully one-third of this accessory/adventure details all-new
rules from Bruce Cordell, the designer who brought you the official
psionics cap system. Inside If Thoughts Could Kill, you'll find:</center><ul><li>
A full-length adventure for 10th-level player characters<li>New psionic
monsters - including the psionic lich and a new PC race<li>Lots of new
items, powers, and even an all-new psionic prestige class<li>The new
discipline of Psychonecromancy and other variant rules<li>More than 300
new powers converted from spells in the <a href="../3e/phb.htm"><i>
Player's Handbook</a> and <a href="eldritch.htm">The
Book of Eldritch Might</i></a><li>Bonus: Psionic Class Alternatives!</ul>
