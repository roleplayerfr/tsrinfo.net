<b>T</b>he DAWNFORGE campaign setting offers you an opportunity to explore
and shape a mythic age, and this player's companion gives you the tools to
do so. Take advantage of the heritage and knowledge of your race with
cultural feats like the Mark of Mordrin, Dance of Blades, and Vision of
Glory. Learn new racial talents and transformations that give minotaurs
the eye of the maze, teach night elves to drink darkness, and imbue
trueborn with the strength of conquest. Play new races, from the
determined ghost elves to the merciless forest wights, all striving to
lead their people to glory.<BR><BR>Each region of the Dawnforge setting
receives attention in these pages, and a new prestige class is presented
for each race, tailored towards its niche in this legendary world. The
Knights Adamant of the Kingsmarch defend the innocent, the fey travelers
of Sildanyr walk the paths between this world and Itheria, and tiefling
diabolists summon powerful allies at terrible costs to their bodies and
souls. Choose their paths, or one of your own. Prepare to make a name
for yourself in the Age of Legend.<BR><BR><center>Requires the use of the
Dungeons & Dragons <a href="../3e/phb35.htm">Player's Handbook</a>,
