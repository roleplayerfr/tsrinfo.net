The night air is chilly, but the crackling fire you've started warms
your bones comfortably. Crickets chirp, and you smile up at the stars,
glad for the quiet evening.<BR>There is a loud roar, and you are
blinded momentarily as the campfire suddenly surges up into the air.
The flames split down the middle, revealing an abyss that leeches the
warmth from your soul. Out of this hellish place stumbles a
black-cloaked figure clutching a scythe. Quickly, you reach for your
weapons.<BR>The strange apparition staggers for a moment. Then,
gathering its strength, it pulls back the hood on its cloak. Beneath
is a bleached skull with stars for eyes.<BR>"I am Azrael, Lord of the
Undead," it hisses. "Or rather, I will be Azrael, after Time itself
has died."<BR>Even as Azrael speaks, decay begins to eat away at its
body, and the god shudders. Holding one arm up to watch as tiny
fissures form in its bones, the deity sighs, "Ah, sweet Entropy,come to
claim me at last."<BR>Its gaze sweeps back to you. "But no, not just
yet. First, I must set events in motion."<BR>Weakness begins to
overcome Azrael, and it sinks to one knee. "Long ago, I became the
most powrful of all the gods, in spite of my enemies' efforts to stop
me. Delirious with power, I destroyed the other gods and eventually
fell to feasting upon the souls of their worshippers. After devouring
every living creature, I consumed the planets and, eventually, the
stars themselves, until I was left alone, in darkness."<BR>The god
struggles to finish its message as its bones turn to dust and blow
away. "Unexpectedly, I felt remorse for what I had done. I grieved
for the universe I had destroyed, but I lacked the power to recreate
it. So, I have come to you, to beg you to do what I cannot."<BR>
Azrael reaches into its cloak and produces a leather sack. "Take these
items and use them."<BR>As Azrael dissolves, its gasps out. "Kill me
tonight, or tomorrow will never dawn."<BR>All that remains is a pile
of dust and a leather bag.
