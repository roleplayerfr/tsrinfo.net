While planning ahead for each gaming session is critical, often times
players do something unexpected. This can leave DMs struggling for
quality material on a moment's notice. It is for this reason the
Common Ground series was created.<BR><BR>Why would you need to use this
book? Your players have taken an unexpected detour and you need a
quick encounter for them (create a small inn). The party decides to
seek clerical services froma second or third temple found within the
town because they suspect the main church to have a spy (create a
medium good church). After defeating a small band of orcs, the PCs are
looking for a way to replenish their supplies without going all the
way back to town (create a tiny merchant tent).<BR><BR>This unique
generation system will allow a DM to have a fully detailed map of the
church, inn, or merchant; stock it with fully equipped NPCs of any
race or alignment; have domain and spell information for all NPCs,
and merchandise for stores - all in under five miinutes in a handy
reference sheet.
