<center><b>When Evil Comes</b><BR><BR>Written by the father of gaming himself,
Gary Gygax, the Slayer's Guide to Undead is a 128 page book jam packed full of
new information on creatures of the night. From the humble skeleton, through
the dreaded wraith, to the most powerful liches of all, this Slayer's Guide
will revitalise any campaign with new and exciting ways to bring the dead to
life. New creatures are fully detailed, along with tips on how to use undead
in campaigns and fill players with dread whenever they appear. A complete
mini-scenario, penned by Gary Gygax, is also included to set players off in the
most desperate quest they will yet face.<BR><BR><b>Inside you will find:</center><BR>
The Unwilled Living Dead</b><BR>Skeletons and zombies might well seem to many
to be boring and of little threat to an accomplished party of adventurers,
however, they can be so much more. Detailing the less intelligent but
certainly not less undead creatures, this chapter offers a mini-slayer's guide
on each of the unwilled undead creatures presented.<BR><BR><b>The Free Willed
Living Dead</b><BR>Many adventurers flee in terror from the ghast or ghoul and
they are but the least of the free willed undead creatures presented in this
chapter. With new templates, tactics and more each creature is detailed in a
full and comprehensive manner.<BR><BR><b>Spirits of Evil</b><BR>Few things
offer as much terror to a party of adventurers as a creature they cannot hit.
Ghosts, ghasts, wraiths and more are all covered in the context of an
individual slayer's guide on each, including scenario hooks and new forms of
the ghostly.<BR><BR><b>Lords of the Living Dead</b><BR>From legend to your
gaming table, vampires, liches and worse offer opportunity to truly terrify
your player's characters as they try to contend with those who have mastered
death.<BR><BR><b>The Peak of the Nightlord</b><BR>Drawing on the material
presented within this book, a full mini-scenario is included.<BR><BR><center>
