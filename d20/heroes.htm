<center><b>The corners of Théah hold dangers you can scarcely fathom...</b></center><BR>
The world is not a safe place. Around every bend, behind every tree,
beyond the next sand dune lies fabulous wealth and imminent death.
The path you take, the weapon you raise, the spell you cast - every
decision you make brings you face to face with the creatures of Théah.
Some wear human faces like the sinister Prince Villanova or the dreaded
Captain Reis. Others are monsters with no earthly origin: man-eating
sirens, the horrible Schattenmann and the inhuman Sidhe.<BR><BR><i>
Heroes, Villains and Monsters</i> contain a plethora of new threats and
dangers for your swashbuckling campaign. You and your fellow
adventurers will be called upon to uncover the world's darkest secrets
and perhaps become the stuff of legends yourself.<BR><BR><ul><li>Over
