Your search for adventure has lead you to the sleepy town of Crow's
Watch, at the south end of Druna Pass, in the shadow of the Silverbray
Mountains, in the kingdom of Antharp, in the 7th year of the reign of
King Kessel V.<BR>In the few days you have spent here, you have found
the people of Antharp were once prosperous and proud of their king, but
recent events have brought the spirits of these once vibrant people
down. It all began when Herzl, court wizard and trusted advisor to
King Kessel V, and his father before him, left the king's court for
unknown reasons two years ago. Then from the last spring planting to
the autumn harvest, raids by renegade bands of goblins plundered the
border communities of Antharp. Only the onset of winter stopped the
goblins from further destruction, and all efforts to track and run the
goblins to ground have ended in failure.<BR>But instead of the promise
of rebirth and renewal that Spring thaw brings, this new year has
brought only more bad news... the infant heir of King Kessel V, and
only child, has disappeared from within the castle.<BR>The people of
Antharp are slowly becoming discontented with a King that cannot even
protect his own family.<BR>As you sit around the hearth of the Oak Leaf
tavern, five men wearing tabards bearing the crest of King Kessel enter
the room, all but one carrying weapons and hiding armore under their
royal garments. The unarmed man steps to the barkeep, and engages in a
short, but private conversation. You also note the unarmed man passing
the barkeep a coin purse...
