<i>"I believe our sun is setting my dear cousin," Me'enup wheezes in a
nearly inaudible tone and stares into the warm stagnant pool of water
at his feet. The stifling and earthy odor of the tunnel fills his
nostrils, and months of accumulated filth forces pain into his eyes.
"It seems fate has dealt us a horrible blow. I pray and no answers are
forthcoming. I cannot clear my mind nor find balance. I am dying
cousin and it seems that you must die with me!"<BR><BR>Tu'ulan looks up
at Me'enup with his unblinking eyes, remorse wrinkling the scales at
the back of his mouth, "I know m'Lord, we all feel the time is near.
We can run and hide no longer. I am lame, my brother has lost all his
strength, your wife is dying and your child. I yearn to see the sun's
eye shine upon my home, to feel the breeze from our high keeps, to
walk the paths of my forefathers. This will never again be, I am ready
m'Lord."<BR><BR>The pronouncement is final and the knell of death struck
clear in the red wavering light of the fire. Me'enup tenderly placed
his talons upon the brow of his cousin....</i><BR><BR>Journey deeper
into the treacherous goblin kingdoms in search of Evanna, daughter of
the House Rothenheimer. But beware or the Maelstrom will drag you into
the dark plots that surround her. Why was her father assassinated?
What secrets does she hold? Perhaps the answers lie below, in the
dungeon beneath the ruined tower of Dzeebagd.<BR><BR><i>Dzeebagd: Under
