<center><b>THE MIND IS A TERRIBLE THING...</b></center><BR>Psychic powers
may seem like magic, but there's no reason to treat them as such in your
d20 game. <b>The Psychic's Handbook</b> provides a completely independent
system for adding psychic abilities to your campaign, abilities which are
at once more subtle and wider-reaching than magic, powers with their own
applications and limitations that seperate them from the spells of clerics
and wizards, and even the powers of psions. The core of the system is the
psychic, a new class whose mental powers are based on skills and feats. <b>
The Psychic's Handbook</b>, by award-winning game designer Steve Kenson,
provides you with everything you need to integrate the class into your
game, including:<BR><BR><ul><li>The psychic core class and a flavorful
array of supporting prestige classes, like the fire starter, the ghost
stalker, and the mind hunter.</ul><ul><li>Over 40 psychic skills, such as
body control, drain vitality, and pyrokinesis.</ul><ul><li>Over 40 psychic
feats, including mind switch, psychic weapons, and wild talent.</ul><ul><li>
Info on using the psychic in your d20 Modern game, including a psychic
advanced class and skills such as cyberkinesis.</ul><ul><li>Advice on
integrating psychic powers into your campaign.</ul><ul><li>Rules for
psychic phenomena.</ul><ul><li>8 sample psychic factions.</ul><ul><li>And
a whole lot more!</ul><cetner>The inner gateway has been opened. Step
through it and discover a whole new world!</center>
