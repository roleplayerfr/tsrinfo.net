5<sup><font size="-1">th</font></sup> Century B.C.</b></center><BR>Earth,
air, fire, and water. Sonic, cold, acid, and electricity. From elder
elementals and powerful dragons to minor mephits and mysterious outsiders,
creatures major and minor are tied to the powers of the elements.<BR>Some
are friends. Some are foes. All are dangerous.<BR>Continuing the acclaimed
<i>Lore</i> series, this book focuses on a single creature type as well as
related subtypes, opening a portal from the elemental planes to your
campaign. The original elementals themselves have been expanded to include
proud nobles, determined guardians, and pesky haunts. Each creature is
designed with a role in mind, from grudge monsters to chase monsters.
With more than 30 new elementals, six new creatures with elemental subtypes,
and four new prestige classes, <i>Elemental Lore</i> provides dozens of
options for unleashing the power of the elements upon your gaming group.
