<center><b>LAND OF THE LAUGHING MAN</b></center><BR>When the mighty Kadum was
plunged into the ocean, a great wave of the titan's blood inundated part of the
continent of Termana. In the aftermath of this divine flood arose the
nightmarish wilderness known as Blood Bayou.<BR><BR>Ruled now by the Laughing
Man - known also as the Jack of Tears, Momus, the Black Jester, and a host of
other names - the bayou is a place of darkness, disease and twisted creatures.<BR><BR>
This sourcebook explores that wetland of mysteries and horrors - from the
bayou settlements to new magic, monsters and adventure ideas. <b>Blood Bayou</b>
also reveals the truth about the Jack of Tears: his history, his schemes, his
followers and his legacy of evil.<BR><BR>So, come; enter the swamp of secrets.
The Laughing Man awaits.<BR><BR><center>REQUIRES THE USE OF THE DUNGEONS &
