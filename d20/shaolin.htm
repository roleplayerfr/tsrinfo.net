<center><b>WHEN SYSTEMS COLLIDE...</b></center><BR>Now is the time when
corrupt eunuch officials undermine a once-great ruling Dynasty; when
martial artists, white-bearded old masters, and supernatural creatures
struggle for control of powerful chi forces; when a band of honorable
warriors is called upon to battle a demon sorcerer in a legendary
mountain monastery...<BR><BR>...This is one demon in dire need of some
Kung Fu butt kicking!<BR><BR><i>Burning Shaolin</i> is a dual-system
D20/<b>Feng Shui</b> adventure. It includes:<BR><BR>Complete rules for
playing the scenario with either an existing 7th- to 9th-level D20
group, or beginning <b>Feng Shui</b> characters.<BR><BR>New D20 rules
for fast-paced action movie-style combat: "Faceless Horde" rules
provide large groups of opponents for the heroes to bowl quickly
through, in large part to show off how buff the PCs are; the <i>wuxia</i>
combat rules let D20 characters defy gravity and perform the stunts
<b>Feng Shui</b> is known for.<BR><BR>New D20 goodies: Mushroom Men that
explode when mistreated, Demon Monks, poisonous Demon Ichor, the <i>rod
of lingering agony</i>, and wondrous <i>flying coffins</i> powered by
those imprisoned within.<BR><BR>Furious Kung Fu action!<BR><BR><center><i><b>
CORIOLIS</b></i></center><BR><i>Burning Shaolin</i> is the first of

Look for future <b>Coriolis</b> titles to bring the D20 systems together
with many of Atlas Games' other RPGs.
