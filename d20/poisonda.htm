Wisp of Pallstone. These are but three of the lethal poisons that grace
the pages of this book. Never again will your characters yawn at the
mention of a poisoned arrow or the sight of a venomous serpent. For instead
of merely being weakened by the kiss of poison, they may find themselves
deafened, unable to cast spells, or thrown into the very depths of fear!<BR><BR>
The first in our <i>Complete</i> line of d20 sourcebooks, this tome
contains so much more than a simple recitation of poisons. A free-form
poison creation system means the product of your skill will be limited
only by the breadth of your imagination. The <i>Complete</i> treatment
includes:<BR><BR><ul><li>Detailed rules for magical poisons, harvesting
raw materials from vanquished foes, and creating antidotes.</ul><ul><li>
More than 40 new feats, including metapoison feats, epic feats, and the
dreaded Toxic Substitution.</ul><ul><li>Over 30 poison-related spells,
including the ultimate in retributive magic: Vengeance on Tainted Hands.</ul><ul><li>
An armory-full of new equipment and magic items, like the sinister
Hollow-Blade and the legendary Staff of Serpents.</ul><ul><li>Six new
prestige classes, including the Ki Corrupted and Toxomancer.</ul><ul><li>
A menagerie's worth of baneful creatures, featuring the venomous gaze of
the Syrallax and the grim essence of the Toxic Deathlord.</ul><ul><li>
Adventure seeds incorporating all of the new rules for levels 1-20,
including fully statted NPCs.</ul><ul><li>Detailed notes for using the
Poisoncraft rules in any <i>Monte Cook's</i> <a href="arcanaunearthed.htm">
Arcana Unearthed</a></i> campaign.</ul>You might find all of that in a
regular sourcebook. In a <i>Complete</i> sourcebook, that's just the
beginning! Blue Devil Games also gives you: rules on poison decay, the
perils of handling poison, two versions of the poison cleric domain,
three creature templates, a random poison naming table, a detailed
description of all nineteen poison families, a character sheet addendum,
and a Poisoncraft worksheet for creating new poisons. Oh, and did we
mention the Codex Venenorum, with more than 50 poisons!
