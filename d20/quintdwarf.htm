<center>While not as pretty as an elf or as quick as a gnome, the dwarf
is the heartiest of all races. His health is legendary and his
resistance to poisons and spells keep him standing when others fall.
Combined with the dwarven work ethic, these natural abilities make
this race one that simply will not quit when the going gets tough.
Forged in the dark fires fare below the surface, dwarves are much more
than they first appear, with great warriors among their number but also
a growing population of wizards, rogues, and even druids rising to
positions of power in dwarven culture. Within the pages of this book
you'll find the information you need as a player to make the most of
your dwarven character, allowing him to grow and develop in new and
exciting ways.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</center><BR>Character
