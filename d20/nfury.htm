<b>Nature's Fury</b><BR>Cold winds and harsh climates can be just as
deadly as swords and spells.<BR><BR><b>Nature's Fury</b> contains two
complete d20 adventure scenarios, each featuring an icy challenge for a
party of four characters. These adventures are designed to fit easily
into an ongoing campaign, and wherever possible the Game Master is
given options on modifying and replacing parts of the background with
elements of his or her own game world.<BR><BR><b>Nature's Fury</b>
contains full color cardstock counters fully compatible with the d20
system and each creature's size and facing stats.<BR><BR><b>Swords
Through the Ice Gates</b> by Mike Mearls. An adventure for four 6th-level
characters.<BR>The hamlet of Owen's Point sits quietly under three inches
of snow. The air has a sharp cold in it, the kind that penetrates even
the thickest of furs like frozen daggers driven by the howling winds.
If today were early winter, those of Owen's Point would just shake their
heads and comment that winters are nothing like they used to be, back
in the day.<BR>Yet today is but a week past midsummer, and the people
of Owen's Point are no longer around to comment on the weather.<HR><b>
The Crystal Tower</b> by James Bell. An adventure for four 5th-level
characters.<BR>The spring comes early this year. After a bountiful
harvest season, winter was unusually short and warm, especially so in
the coastal city of Varloon. The trading galleys from the Northlands
now follow the warm winds down along the coast, their holds full of rich
furs and pelt, rare ores, and other precious materials valued by the
merchants and elite of Varloon.<BR>Another item of value, rare and
mysterious, has made the journey along the coast and now waits beyond
the harbor of Varloon. Few know the truth about this item and fewer
still own the resources to attain it. Who will be the ones to retrieve
the amulet of wizardly power from the Crystal Tower?<BR><BR>Both of
these adventures feature full color cardstock counters by Claudio Pozas.
