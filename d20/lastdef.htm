The spring thaw is in full force. The sun shines brightly over the
Brathmoor Mountains, shooting streaks of color across the snowy clouds.
The streams and rivers run fast, swollen with melting ice and snow. The
local rangers have declared the trails clear for travel, through Genmarr
Pass to the coast on the opposite side.<BR><BR>Your party has traveled
several days to reach Genmarr Pass. Aside from a few trappers and
woodsmen you haven't seen many other travelers. The pass is generally
quiet this time of year, but these last few days have seemed unusually
still. It's as if the entire area is waiting for something to happen...<BR><BR>
The merchants said this would be an easy undertaking. Just trek up to
the dizzying heights of Genmarr Pass, retrieve their ill-fated caravan,
and take it to the port city of Desburg on the other side of the
Mountains. Yet each step up the mountain feels... wrong.<BR><BR>Your
lungs burn as the altitude take its toll. As you round a bend in the
trail, you spot the remains of the caravan you were sent to find.
Behind it, looming in the lengthening shadows of dusk lurks the hulking
towers and battlements of The Cursed Gateway... a long, unmanned
battlement from a bygone era. Are the legends about the Gateway true?
Is the pass truly haunted?
