<center><b>Welcome to the Age of Exploration!</b></center><BR>Ptalmanar
is a world of uneasy balance. It was created by gods who do not just
coexist but stand eternally linked on a heavenly wheel where each one
sits opposite its enemy, holding the wheel in balance. At the center
of the known world lies a continent where two empires stand, tied by
history and by blood, both on the battlefields and in the veins of their
royalty, who follow the example of the gods and sit in opposition to
each other. In these two culturally rich empires the pantheon's strength
is so great that a church can be as important as a fortress and a
cathedral is often more a center of power than a castle.<BR><BR>And time
sails forward:<BR>While the two empires hold true to the old ways of
human rule, relying on the sword, the spell, and the holy symbol to
maintain the balance...<BR><BR>Ptalmanar's edges hum with advancement:<BR><BR>
The lands that surround the imperial continent are mysterious and strange.
Sailing ships of exploration and warfare have become great celebrity, as
they develop technology quickly, seeking to expand the holdings of
their empires, and give hope and excitement to a tired people. The
strange races of Ptalmanar are much freer outside of the empires, where
they can wield their unique strengths without suspicion. On the seas
each captain wears a spyglass on one hip and a pistol on the other, and
in the other lands of Ptalmanar the origins and mysteries of the world
wait to be discovered.<BR><BR><i>Twin Crowns: Age of Exploration Fantasy</i>
