<center><b>ANYBODY HOME?</b></center><BR>Have your players wandered off
the beaten path yet again? Didn't have time to map out that castle?
Just open <i>Seven Strongholds</i> to find forts, castles, and other
well-fortified locations, fully detailed and ready for insertion into
your game world.<BR><BR><i>The Barrows:</i> A concrete bunker allows a
determined troop of gnomes to hold at bay the misshapen monsters of
the subterranean world, intent on breaking through to the surface.<BR><BR>
<i>Castle Briar:</i> An elven warlord protects his living castle from
jealous rivals.<BR><BR><i>Gloom Keep:</i> Under a sunless sky, grim-faced
humans protect their senile, maddened deity from the world.<BR><BR><i>
Old Mound Fort:</i> An iron-age ditch-and-rampart fort, refurbished by
halfling adventurers offers a way station for treasure-hungry dungeon
explorers.<BR><BR><i>Steelface Point:</i> An imposing dwarven fortress
protects the mouth of a mountain pass from the orcish horde and its
war machines.<BR><BR><i>The Perch:</i> Keen-eyed bird-men zealously
guard their domed lair, from which they oppress the area's population of
"walkers" - their contemptuous term for flightless humanoids.<BR><BR><i>
Uthront Fort:</i> Ambitious half-orcs occupy a newly-built motte-and-bailey
castle as an early stage of their effort to mold the local humanoid
raiders into a mighty and unified army.<BR><BR>Like all Penumbra products,
<i>Seven Strongholds</i> gives you material adaptable to any fantasy
campaign, whether it be a published setting or a world of your own
creation.<BR><BR><center>Requires the use of the Dungeons & Dragons
