Sword and Sorcery books are published under the Open Game License and

rules.<BR><BR>The ratmen - or, as they call themselves, the slitheren -
are some of the deadliest foes adventurers can face: foul humanoid rodents,
intent on spreading evil throughout the lands of men, elves, and
dwarves. In the dank reachers of the Mourning Marshes, the many broods
of ratmen have come together in a profane alliance, intent on mayhem and
the downfall of all other races.<BR><i>Vigil Watch: Warrens of the
Ratmen</i> includes a wealth of information about the ratmen, their
culture, society, and biology. Here, you will read of their diabolical
plots and schemes, of the twisted monsters that lurk in the deadly
marshlands. Here, too, is information on new broods of slitheren - the
sorcerous Black Pelts, the powerful Storm Chasers, the cunning Forge
Crawlers, and the enigmatic Unseeing, as well as rules for developing
slitheren as player characters. Two detailed ratman settlements come
ready-made for adventuring.<BR><BR>Join the struggle - meet the slitheren
and their minions face to face. And pray that you live to tell the
tale.
