Your long journey is coming to an end, at least for one night. You
approach the woodland town of Blackbrook, a small village you've passed
through before.<BR><BR>Walking along the trail leading into the center
of Blackbrook, you can feel the sense of doom that shrouds this village
and its people. The villagers seem weak and underfed, and they stare
distantly into nothingness.<BR><BR>You hear a commotion coming from the
center of the village, at the small community well. Several villagers
surround a young woman in robes who frantically pleads, "You must listen
to me! It is the well water that pollutes this village, and all of you
must stop drinking from it! Please listen to me!"<BR><BR>The villagers
pressing around her look tired, ill, and desperate. They're obviously
no warriors and their pitchforks, woodsman's axes, and broomsticks make
poor weapons. But they just as clearly mean to do the young woman bodily
harm if she remains standing between them and the well.<BR><BR>The woman
looks hopefully at you as you approach, worry etched in the lines of
her face.<BR><BR>"I've tried to tell them! The well water is poisoned,
corrupted by some terrible evil! But they won't listen to me... please
help us!"
