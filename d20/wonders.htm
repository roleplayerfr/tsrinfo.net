<i>You pause in your search. Dust that has lain in these ruins for
centuries claws at your throat. Lifting the wineskin to your lips you
notice an oddly-shaped stone just below the ruined carvings at the edge
of the ceiling. Strange, you've looked there a dozen times and never
noticed in before.<BR><BR>A shallow symbol is etched in the stone.
Brushing away the accumulated grime and dirt, you see the Merithian
character for "right hand". Smiling at that hard-won bit of knowledge,
you turn to your right renewed confidence in your quest. Ahead,
something slithers in the shadows, and your sword seems to leap to
your hand...</i><BR><BR>Wonder Out of Time presents a series of
vignettes that can be used individually or together to enrich any
fantasy campaign using the d20 game system. In it you'll find:<BR><BR>
an overview of the ancient Merithian civilization<BR>an abandoned manor
filled with great and deadly secrets<BR>an old Merithian farm infested
with marauding goblinoids<BR>hidden knowledge locked away in an ancient

mysterious temple ruined by exposure, failing magical wards, and
destructive beasts<BR>a legendary library that may contain the keys to
understanding the Merithians<BR>Derimos, the fabled capital of the
Merithians, now ravaged by time and guarded by its most loyal
defenders<BR>detailed information on Merithian Blood Sorcery, new items,
