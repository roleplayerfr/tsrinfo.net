<center>The Corinthian city of Nahab has suffered greatly under the continued
feuding of its noble families in the last decade. Waging small estate wars
between themselves to establish control over trade routes and resource-laden
foothills of the Karpash Mountains, the peasant-titled 'Nobles War' has left
many homes, fields and villages in ruin, and the city's ruling classes on the
dangerous path to self-destruction. Nahab has swelled into the home of
pampered nobles, growing fat off the trade and mining that takes place along
the Karpash Mountain Way. Despite this, the city never grew in the way like
Shadizar and Tarantia, remaining relatively small and manageable by the families
that now controlled it.<BR><BR>But Nahab has just suffered a major loss and
someone plans to use the sorrow and grief to punish the nobles for the years of
unnecessary torment. The unexpected and gruesome death of Father Tericos
Heretio has plunged the entire city's peasant population into a state of
grieving and distrust, with even some of the noble houses lowering their penants
in his honour. This show of respect is not enough for some, who wish to punish
the noble families for all for their combined crimes...<BR><BR>A dark and
sinister terror has been unleashed upon the folks of Nahab, striking innocent
and guilty alike. It hunts, stalks and kills, creating a bloodbath in which
fear and loathing will grip the hearts of Nahab's citizens. The city cries out
for salvation.<BR><BR>Conan and the Lurking Terror of Nahab is a scenario designed
for four to six Player Characters of between 4<sup><font size="-1">th</font></sup>
and 6<sup><font size="-1">th</font></sup> character level. Moral decisions and
hard choices block the path in this adventure as often as bands of brigands or
secret doors, as Player Characters become embroiled in the legend of the Terror
of Nahab.</center>
