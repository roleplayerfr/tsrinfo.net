<center><b>The End of A Quest?</b></center><BR>There it lay, the fabled
<i>holy sword of Karith</i>, within the onyx altar just as the legends
told. As you step over the corpses of the final guardian creatures,
you shift your shield to your back. Your thoughts turn towards your
triumphant return with this wondrous item of legend. But as your hand
reaches for the hilt, the wizard screams. Turning, you see a gathering
blackness, containing a monstrous winged figure that is blacker still.
Your nostrils fill with the sulfurous vapors of the Abyss and you hear
its booming voice, freezing you where you stand: <i>FOOL! Did you
believe I would let this be so EASY?</i><BR><BR><center><b>Wicked
Hiding Places</b></center><BR>Need a difficult hiding place for that <i>
holy sword</i> your paladin is questing for? Then <b>Demons and Devils</b>
is for you! <b>Demons and Devils</b> is the first module in our "Lair"
series, a set of modules containing short adventures useable in one or
two game sessions for the overworked Dungeon Master who doesn't need a
full-scale dungeon. Published under the D20 system, <b>Demons and
Devils</b> contains three short, difficult dungeons: <i>The Sorceror's
Citadel, "Ras Evil Grin"</i> and <i>The Pit of Despair</i>. Each of
these is a perfect hiding place for items a party may be questing for.
And, in the fine <b>Necromancer Games</b> tradition, each of these
short dungeons centers around a demon or devil which guards that item.
We've made the dungeon, you decide what you want to hide there. Now
sit back and watch your players try to get it!
