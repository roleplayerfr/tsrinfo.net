<center><b>Ferocious Reptilian Tribesmen</b><BR><BR>The most blasphemous of
scholars would place the creation of the world not in the hands of the gods,
but in the hands of nature herself. In such a creation myth it was not the
elves or the dragons who came first, but the reptiles - the dinosaurs, the
crocodiles, the lizards and the lizardfolk. Of course, such a myth has
little basis in the truth of things, but it is an interesting postulation.
There is no doubt that the race of creatures known as lizardfolk, or
lizardmen, is an ancient one indeed. Often overlooked because of their
savagery and animalistic tendencies, the lizardfolk people are as much a
part of the history of the world as men, dwarves and elves.<BR><BR>As a
reptilian race, lizardfolk prefer to live in the warmer parts of the
world, in swamps and marshes throughout such climates. They often build
settlements of dome-like mud huts deep within swamps, hidden away and
guarded against outsiders who would harm the tribe. Lizardfolk are
unpredictable within their habitat - sometimes dealing peacefully with
outsiders, sometimes attacking them ferociously. Adventurers travelling
through swampland should be vigilant - their passing will almost certainly
be known to the near invisible lizardfolk sentries but they may never
realise that they were being watched. If provoked into a fight, lizardfolk
are a very dangerous people indeed.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</b><BR><BR><table cellpadding="5">
