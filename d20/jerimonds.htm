Ten days ride north of the great city, there is a small town named
Treefall. Up until recently, this town was well known for its rich
harvests, happy villages, and prosperous weather.<BR>These days, however,
the once-proud details from Trefall have turned darker. Instead of
tales of unending prosperity, you hear hushed whispers of a great curse
that has struck the once-happy village. Word has it that, where once
roamed contented cattle, now strange beasts hunt by the moon's cold
light and terrorize the haples region.<BR>You have scoffed with the
others at the these stories. Despite the things you've seen in your
adventures with your friends, the thought that such ill might befall
such a sleepy little town strikes you as terribly unlikely. There is
plenty of evil in the world, true, but there are also much bigger and
better targets. But tonight, despite the firmess of your disbelief,
the stories come to find you.<BR>You have been traveling north along
the roads on your own business, enjoying the rich fall colors and warm
afternoons. Your camp is small and secure, with a roaring fire and
meat cooking over the flame. It's one of those crisp autumn days that
makes you long for a warm hearth after a long ride in the cool air.
Still, the fire is good enough for now, and you and your friends have a
wonderful meal, talking and singing and laughing, anticipating a restful
sleep beneath the blanket of stars.<BR>Until the beast attacks.
