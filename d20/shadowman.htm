<center><b><i>Welcome to</i></b><BR>Shadowman's Twisted Treasury - A
Collection of Killer Puzzles. I'm Shadowman, and if you look at the front
cover you'll see my Treasury. How many traps do you see guarding it? Five?
Sorry, try again next life. Now do you understand the Killer Puzzles part?<BR><BR>
If you like challenging puzzles you've come to the right place. My
Treasury has 30 of 'em and I'll personally guarantee that there is something
here for every level of puzzle solver.<BR><BR>If that's not enough for
you, I'll even give you a unique hint and step system that makes it
possible for you to have a chance on even the toughest of puzzles. Open
up the book and try one.<BR><BR>But wait - there's more (I love that
phrase). There's also Shadowman's Twisted Maze, an amazing puzzle with
which you can torment/entertain your friends.<BR><BR>More fun than
eggplant!<BR><b><i>-Shadowman</i></b><BR><BR>P.S.- Do you like
role-playing? There is a section just for you that shows you how to use
these puzzles in any d20 game.</center>
