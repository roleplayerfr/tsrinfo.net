<center><b>A Pit of Savagery</b><BR><BR>Home to over twenty-five thousand
orcs, Skraag is a city of pure brutality, a place of nightmare that
even the bravest adventurer will fear to tread. Built from the ruins of
an ancient dwarven stronghold the orcs themselves destroyed, the hordes
of Skraag range for miles in every direction, bringing slaughter and
misery to any community unfortunate enough to be within range of their
predations.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:<BR><BR>City History:</b>
Discover how the dwarves of Ironhallow Hall lost their home in a dramatic
battle with the orc hordes.<BR><BR><b>Government:</b> Despite being run
by orcs, Skraag has a convoluted government with several factions all
vying to wrest control from the warlords of the City Master.<BR><BR><b>
Daily Life:</b> For most of the orcs and goblins that dwell within
Skraag, life is a misery beset by poverty and brutality. Yet they
continue to thrive, posing an ever present threat to every civilised
nation within range of the rampaging hordes.<BR><BR><b>Religion:</b>
The gods of Skraag hold sway over vast segments of the unruly population,
their priests guiding the hordes into predetermined paths to serve, an
as yet, hidden purpose.<BR><BR><b>Tour of the City:</b> Walk the burnt
out streets and dank caverns of Skraag, avoiding the most dangerous
regions in an effort just to survive in this most violent of civilisations.<BR><BR>
<b>Movers and Shakers:</b> Full details are given on the inhabitants of
Skraag, from the barkeep Gireous Phlog, through to the infamous City
Master, Cylus Groon and the Demon Lord Kharkus. Watch orcs rise through
the ranks of the Silver Tusks and spread throughout the Disciples of the
Asphibyiex or the Mended Ones.</center>
