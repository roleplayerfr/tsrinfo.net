<b>COMBAT NEEDN'T BE "BY THE NUMBERS"...</b><BR><BR>The current combat rules
are efficient, yet they lack a certain flair for the dramatic and realistic
nature of battles. While a Game Master can weave fantastic in-depth
narrations of a harrowing conflict with a fearsome monster, as soon as a
character takes a serious blow resulting in a critical injury, the
existing Hit Point system breaks down. How do you use numbers to explain
a character getting an arm ripped off by a giant, or a dragon biting your
fighter in half?<BR><BR><b><i>Torn Asunder</i></b> provides a complete and
comprehensive system for critical hits in any d20 game. The system is
elegant and easy to use, does not do away with hit points, or even alters
the combat rules. It simply provides an optional way to deal with
critical hits besides piling on additional damage. Critical hits are
real hits - disabling function, mangling body parts, and leaving real
wounds behind.<BR><BR><b><i>Torn Asunder</i></b> pulls no punches; it
provides a realistic and effective injury system for d20, covering all
creatures, anatomies, and body types. Included as well are expanded rules
for natural healing, scatification, and herbal treatments. <b><i>Torn
Asunder</i></b> also provides a wide variety of resources allowing
characters to take advantage of the new system, from quick and precise
prestige classes to devastating weapons and protective armor to powerful
and essential magical devices and spells.<BR><BR><center>Requires the use
