Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
This book of dungeon geomorphs gives you everything you need to map out
exciting underground adventures. The geomorphs are modular map segments
designed to be combined in a variety of ways. There are 120 map segments,
encompassing mazes, dungeons, underdark caverns, monstrous lairs, castles,
ruins, halls, and many other intriguing places to explore. Together they
combine to make thousands of possible maps!
If you enjoy this adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl Classics
series!
