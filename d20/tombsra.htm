<b>The Fabled Valley of the Kings...</b><BR><BR>...has stood all but untouched
for millennia. Few of those that have ever been within its confines have
returned alive - and none have returned unchanged. It is a place of honor where
the most powerful rulers and intellectual leaders of the greatest civilizations
of the distant past are interred. But those civilizations are dead, as are any
who would venerate these dark crypts. Now, the valley is ruled by those left
behind to guard it from thieves and grave robbers.<BR><BR><b>Treasure and
Danger Abound!</b><BR><BR>Only the greatest and most respected leaders are
interred in the Valley of the Kings. Befitting their station, they were
surrounded with only the best and most valuable of gifts to see them off into
the afterlife. But just as their people left behind great riches, so too did
they leave behind powerful guardians to protect the tombs of their heroes from
those who would defile and plunder them. The Valley of the Kings promises
riches beyond the dreams of avarice, but any looking to claim that prize must
first face the traps and guardians left behind - and they defend their
wealth jealously.<BR><BR><b>The Secrets of Ages Past!</b><BR><BR>This isn't
just a realm for t he dead. The valley is something far more than just a place
to bury the dead. Dark dark forces operate within the Valley of the Kings,
searching for an escape from an everlasting prison, while other powerful
brings watch carefully over the valley to ensure that nothing escapes its
confines. Or no one. Do your characters have the courage to face the deadly
challenges of this fabled land?<BR><BR>Visit <a href="http://www.fastforwardgames.com/">
