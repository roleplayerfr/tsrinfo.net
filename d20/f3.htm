<center><b>A Gruesome Discovery</b></center><BR>A scream pierces the early
morning air. A crowd gathers at the docks to witness the ghastly sight.
The body of a little girl - her throat slit, her body mutilated - has been
found tangled in a fisherman's net. There are a few tears and curses, but
for the most part simply a resigned and uneasy silence. In any other city
this would be tragedy enough to break anyone's heart, but the people of
Penmorgh know that this is just the beginning. For almost a century they
have borne witness to this tragedy and by midsummer night two more girls
will be dead. Unless someone can end the horror once and for all.<BR><BR><center><b>
A Peril in Penmorgh</b></center><BR>The Crystal Skull is an epic adventure
which whisks the heroes from the streets and sewers of a major city, on a
tense and perilous cross-country chase, into the depths of a haunted
dwarven city, and to the dizzying heights of a perilous tower crafted by
the hand of Orcus himself! Can the heroes find the crystal skull and
banish a great threat or will they forever be remembered as the villains
who set a great evil lose upon the world?<BR><BR>"Requires the use of the
