<b>Invade the Tower of an Archmage!</b><BR><BR><i>"...and so it stands
today, this evil magical fortress. A curse upon the lands of the
Kingdom of Kula and a pox upon her peoples. Yet if the oracle can be
believed, then the time has come for that to change. I spare your
treachery against the crown on one condition. You must set foot
inside Darkspyre on the morrow and sabotage her defenses. My War
priests wish it so, and if their portents are true - and if you are as
powerful as you claim to be - then this evil black tower of sorcery
shall fall and Malkanai will tremble before the holy army of the
mighty Kula!"<BR><BR>As General Kaga's thundering speech turns to talk
of the oncoming siege, your eye wanders to where the tower of the
Archmage Malkanai slashes the sky like an enormous obsidian knife.
Memories of fireside tales of the nefarious mage challenge you courage
and your stomach begins to wind itself into a knot. Of course you are
every bit as powerful as you have told the General - but are you and
your stalwart companions really strong enough to challenge an Archmage -
and in his own home?</i><BR><BR>Building Block Adventures (BBAs) are
