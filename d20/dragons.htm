As your party comes over the rise of the hill, the dragon comes into
view beneath you: A massive golden body, lying in sharp contrast amidst
the tall emerald grass beneath a small grove of trees. Although its
blood flows from a plethora of wounds and the mighty muscles that line
its sides heave slowly with labored breathing, you see that there is
a majesty about this creature that remains even as it struggles with
the slow spiral of death.<BR><BR>At your cautious approach the
dragon's flickering lids fly open, and you find yourself suddenly
staring into eyes whose unfathomable depths betray the great age of
history that lies behind them. A voice that was once melodious and
deep rasps forth with sounds that will soon become a death rattle:<BR><BR>
"You must help me...<BR><BR>"I know you to be heroes. Know me to be
Al'theirean'il'hariad'el'theron. In this, my final hour, I must beg
your aid. I ask you to take your sword and pierce me here." His
jagged claw points to his breast. "Take my heart. Carry it to the
Hall of Dragons, wherein lie the hearts of all my kin. Do this and you
shall be rewarded by the Keepers of the Hall."<BR><BR>A keening wail of
mortal pain echoes through the grove, and then the dragon speaks his
final words: "Please. Grant my dying wish."<BR><BR>And then the light
is gone from those noble, gold-streaked orbs... And all is silent
within the grove.
