It's a warm summer evening, just about perfect. A cool breeze blusters
in from the northwest, carrying the promise of the encroaching autumn
with it, but at the moment it brings you a welcome relief from the heat
of the day.<BR>After spending most of your summer delving into the
deeps and dungeons beneath the land, you're just happy to be able to
relax in the comforts of a world in which the sun sets and rises. For
what seems like the first time in ages, you're not so worried about
what might by lurking just around the corner or behind the next door as
you are about the terrible prospect of draining dry the local tavern's
stores.<BR>You have just finished a marvelous dinner at the Stumble Inn.
(The weathered wooden sign creaking over the door depicts a booted
foot tripping over a lump of gold.) The innkeeper and his wife - Carbad
and Kamalda, an honest pair of retired farmers as weatherbeaten as their
place's sign - have hauled out their very best for you. They know that
you are restless to be on your way and that they aren't bound to have
the pleasure of your company for much longer.<BR>Just as you are about
to raise a toast to your deserving host, a rumpled shape staggers through
the inn's open door.<BR>You reach for your weapon, startled at the
intrusion, but before you can act, the figure crumples to the floor.
The innkeeper dashes over and turns the stricken stranger onto his
back. "Marcaeus!" he gasps, then looks back up at you, his face filled
with dread.<BR>You rush to the fallen man's side. He's alive, but
barely so. He's literally been beaten within an inch of his life, and
his right leg is twisted at a decidely uncomfortable angle.<BR>You roll
the man over onto his back, and he groans loudly as the bones in his
battered leg crunch together. His eyes flicker for a moment and then
open wide. His gaze, clouded by his intense pain, fixes directly on
you.<BR>Just before he mercifully passes out, he reaches up and grabs
you by the front of your shirt.<BR>"My son," he whispers through his
battered lips, "they've got my son!"
