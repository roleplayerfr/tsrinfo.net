<b><i>Into the Green</i></b> provides rich detail for four different types of
green environments, describing the ecology, terrain, hazards, and resources of
each. From tall alpine forests to dark foreboding woods, from lonely and
sprawling plains to dense and sweltering jungles, no feature is left out.<BR><BR>
<b><i>Into the Green</i></b> is designed as a guidebook for both players and
DMs alike, providing the resources needed to flesh out a wilderness campaign,
and the knowledge needed to survive in one. For the DM, <b><i>Into the Green</i></b>
details the living creatures and the unique conditions that make up each of the
four terrains. Trees, plants, animals, microorganisms, monsters, pitfalls, and
climates are all included - the complete cycle of life is defined.<BR><BR>
Along with each of the environments are a wide variety of skills, substances,
spells, concoctions, devices, gear, and information invaluable for dealing
with the specific hazards of the wilds. Every plant tells a story, every
creature provides a clue to success, and every monster is a treasure in and of
itself.<BR><BR><i><b>Into the Green</b></i> requires the use of the <b>Dungeons
