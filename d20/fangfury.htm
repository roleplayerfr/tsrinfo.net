<center><b>Feed the Hunger!</b></center><BR>Vampire enemies are a staple of
fantasy adventure, but the standard race is too powerful for Player Character
use in most d20 campaigns. <i>Fang & Fury: A Guidebook to Vampires</i> presents
a new race, the vampire scion, which is balanced for play with conventional PC
races. These mysterious creatures have their own history, traditions, and paths
to power; and though individuals can come to rival the power of elder vampires,
they are always vulnerable to the touch of the sun, or the attack of a holy
warrior. <i>Fang & Fury</i> includes:<BR><BR><ul><li>The vampire scion template,
expanded rules for vampiric strengths and weaknesses, and vampire campaign
options.<li>Alternate racial concepts, such as the natural vampire and psychic
vampire.<li>Over 30 new feats, including Drain Spinal Fluid and Hypnotic Voice.<li>
9 new prestige classes, such as the Black Abbot, Masqued Player, and Vampire
Mage.<li>A dozen new creatures: allies and minions of the vampire lords.<li>
Two sample vampire religions.<li>Over a dozen new spells and three new domains
(Blood, Greed, and Mania).<li>New equipment, magic items, and artifacts.<li>
Ready-to-use vampire scion NPC stats in handy table form.</ul>This definitive
vampire sourcebook is the perfect accessory to add these bloodthirsty
creatures to any d20 campaign. Sharpen your fangs... it's time to feed!
