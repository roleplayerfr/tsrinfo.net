<b>The figure is that of a human male nearly six-and-a-half feet tall,
dressed in dark brown travelling robes, a long gnarled staff held in
his right hand. He seems old, but strong, with a weathered face that
exudes confidence, curiosity, and a piercing inquisitiveness. A great
wolf stand beside him, nearly three feet high, its fur a brilliant
silver tinge. It eyes you warily but without fear. As the man begins
to speak, you feel a brief tingle run up your spine.<BR><BR>"I am
Cuhulain, guardian of The Path and protector of the lands you call the
West Wood and beyond. My Order strives to maintain the natural ways,
seeking and correcting imbalances in the world before us. The lands to
the north have been poisoned for years beyond even my great age, tainted
by something that is not part of this world's natural cycle. I have
studied this foulness, and its powers are grim indeed. I will not
tolerate violations in the natural order!"</b><BR><BR><i>The Silver
