The legend of the <i>Iron Codex</i> is told only when the winter is the
thickest, and snow has covered all the roads of the land. A book of
steel pages and wrought-iron bindings, the <i>Iron Codex</i> is said to
destroy any who dare read from its cursed pages. It is said to have
the power to summon strange magic, and if disturbed from its sacred
resting place, its power could destroy the world. Long ago, ancient
heroes placed it upon an altar, guarded and ensorceled to keep the
Codex undisturbed. So long as it is not disturbed, the <i>Iron Codex</i>
will sleep... forever. It is an artifact of immeasurable power and
arcane dangers... but, after all, only a legend.<BR>Then, within the
city where you make your home, a tragic earthquake struck, and a deep
crevice split the city in two. Shortly after the earthquake, a fine
ash began to fall over the city. Day and night for three days, the
ash pours slowly down upon the inhabitants. As it does, a strange
sickness strikes the residents of your home. The innocent are dying.
Clerics struggle to find the cause, sending you to the edge of the
chasm to discover the source of this strange plague.<BR>It is there
that you find the impossible. Deep beneath the city's southern gate,
nearly a hundred feet into a crevice that did not exist, you find a
pair of great iron doors, once sealed with molten silver, built into
the side of the granite wall. The earth has shifted away, and the
earthquake has unsealed the doors, disturbing the sleep of those within.
The thick rain of ash seeps out from the tomb, seeming to whisper and
claw at you as you peer into an unfathomable darkness.<BR>And carved
into the iron of the massive portal gates and the words:<BR><i>"Behold
the Temple of the Iron Codex."</i>
