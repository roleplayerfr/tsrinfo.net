<center><b>The Tribe of the Growling Shield</b><BR><BR>The Fir Domain are one of
the fiercest and most troublesome Tribes of the Earth Goddess. Whereas the
Sessair and Finians will go to war as soon as look at you, the Fir Domain are just
as eager for trouble but always with an eye to the main chance. Likewise, they
can be as cunning as the Tribe of Shadows, but are quite prepared to apply that
intelligence and planning to a frontal assault or even an entire war, rather than
relying on night raids. If they cannot profit from war, and with minimal
casualties, they have no great interest in it. Of course, this could be
long-term profit - taking over fertile farmland can be better in the long run
than capturing a rich town or fort.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</center><BR>
