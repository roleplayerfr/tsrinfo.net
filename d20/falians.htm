<center><b>The Tribe of Shadows</b><BR><BR>Unlike the other Earth Goddess Tribes,
the folk of the Tribe of Shadows place little importance on directness as a
virtue. They will happily sneak up behind an enemy and strangle him, not
thinking it the least bit dishonourable. Before army army brings them to
battle, they may find their general assassinated and warriors out of action
through a does of hallucinogenic fungi in the mead cauldron. Once in combat
they will not shirk from stabbing in the back if the oppurtunity arises, but
their courage on the open battlefield is no less than that of any other Earth
Goddess tribe and they will proudly fight to the death in honour duels or
battles alike.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</b><BR><BR><table cellspacing=10><tr><td>
