<b>The Dragon Empire just got a lot more crowded.</b><BR><BR>Expanding on <b>
Dragonstar</b>, the exciting space-fantasy setting from Fantasy Flight Games,
<i>Galactic Races</i> introduces 16 new player character races with which to
populate the Dragon Empire. Besides reintroducing old favorites such as the
noble centaurs and the savenging kobolds, <i>Galactic Races</i> also adds
several completely new races sure to spice up the Empire. From the enormous and
powerful oruk to the small but arrogant quasta, there's something for everyone.
As an extra bonus, racial templates allow players to customize their characters
even further. Want to play a halfling from a high-G world? Now you can.
<i>Galactic Races</i> is an invaluable resource for any <b>Dragonstar</b> DM
or player.
