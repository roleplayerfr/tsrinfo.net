<center>It is said that when the gods created the world, they gently
blew life into it, awakening the conscience in every piece of their
work. Trees, rocks, rivers, wind, mountains... all of them received
the holy breath, and all of them worhshipped the gods before the first
race set foor on the face of the world. They were the animae, the
souls of all things: the spirits. These beings are the heart of Creation,
overseeing the turning of the seasons, the cycle of predator and prey
and even the falling of each flake of snow. This first age was a
paradise, but when the gods had set the stage for their mortal children,
the spirits lost their place as the inhabitants of the world. Yet they
were not really gone. Shunned to the lands behind the mirror, the
spirits maintained their connection with that which gives them life,
and they served a new role as the intermediaries between the gods and
the physical world.<BR><BR>Shamans existed long before clerics and
wizards usurped their role as the wise leaders of the people, the
first to try and make sense of a strange world and the earliest people
to delve into the powers of the unknown. Their magic is unsophisticated,
and looked down upon as the province of the uncivilised, a primitive
tool inferior to arcane formulae and divine prayer.<BR><BR><b>Inside
