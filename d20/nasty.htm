<b>The Orcs of Hârn</b><BR><BR>The Gargun (also called orcs and
Foulspawn) reside in the high mountainous areas of Hârn, where they
squabble, maim, kill, and cannibalize each other, or any other species
they encounter. This book provides details on Gargun culture, maps of
four orc colonies, and six related adventure scenarios.<BR><BR><b>Bwaft</b><BR>
A natural cave complex situated high in rugged mountains. After centuries
of relative peace, the Gargun of Bwaft find themselves involved in a
vicious war with the nearby Gargun of Huxuth. <i>"A Walk Among Tombstones"</i>
involves the players in this war, while <i>"Dead of Night"</i> provides
them the chance to enrich themselves at the expense of Bwaft's
inhabitants.<BR><BR><b>Ejatus</b><BR>A cave complex with an Araki (small
orc) population ruled by a Khanu (great orc) elite. These Khanu are
highly organized and dangerous, as anyone involved in the. <i>"Dance at
the Slaughterhouse"</i> scenario will soon discover.<BR><BR><b>Fana</b><BR>
A rich silver mine seized by Gargun six centuries ago, and still held
by them despite dozens of attempts at recapture by the dwarves of
Azadmere. The orcs of Fana traditionally skirmish with nearby orc
colonies, and are always a menace to travelers. <i>"The Last Worst
Hope"</i> deals with another dwarven attempt to retake Fana.<BR><BR><b>
Korego</b><BR>The oldest and largest Gargun colony on Hârn. The orcs
of Korego have a long history of conflict with both the local human
tribesmen and merchant caravans. "We Deal in Steel" is a mystery
involving arms-running. "To Live and Die in Korego" gives the players
a rescue mission in which some things are not what they appear.<BR><BR>

for fantasy gaming and suitable for ANY rule system.<BR><BR>Run your epic
quests within a believable, stable, and rational world that <i>could</i>
exist. Why stumble through disjointed chaos?<BR><BR>Quality, detail,
and consistency are our hallmarks. Nothing is better.<BR><BR><b>
HÂRNWORLD SETTING</b><BR><i>Hârn</i> is a medieval world designed for
fantasy gaming. The setting is a large island culturally like 12th
Century Britain, the Age of Chivalry, Richard the Lionheart, and Robin
Hood. <i>Hârn</i> is magic-rare, not magic-weak; powerful mages have a
hand in many "natural" events. Despite small pockets of civilization,
<i>Hârn</i> is a wild land that conceals strange ruins, wild barbarian
tribes, and terrifying beasts.<BR><BR><b>d20 LEVEL OF PLAY (5th - 15th)</b><BR>

<b>six (6)</b> adventures for a party of d20 characters from 5th to
