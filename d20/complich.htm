Do traces of humanity remain after a spellcaster's transformation into a lich?
The answer is yes. This guide to liches humanizes the evil monster that has
traditionally been relegated to the lowest levels of dank, dark dungeons.<BR><BR>
Necromancers pursue the path to lichdom for many reasons. Some are truly evil
with dark plans that will take centuries to complete. But others are looking
for nothing more than immortality. The transformation to lichdom is shrouded
in mystery and secrecy, and few who undertake the process fully understand the
implications. Many are completely unaware that the enigmatic rituals that
promise immortality have sinister side effects. Thus it is possible that some
liches were once paladins pursuing a centuries-long plan of good, or researchers
who only wanted a few more years to complete their studies. Over time, the
necromantic energies of the creation rituals corrupted them, and now they are
evil liches... but the spark of humanity remains.<BR><BR>The Complete Guide to
Liches introduces the concept of the redeemed lich, who has sloughed off his
undead life of evil, and the philolich, a mortal lover reanimated by her lich
companion to keep him company as he whiles away his centuries. The "typical"
lich is examined in detail, along with several new varieties, including the
monstrously powerful drowlich and the time-challenged novalich (whose more
limited creation rituals give him but one year to complete a specific task).<BR><BR>
The Complete Guide to Liches is a stand-alone, world-neutral sourcebook covering
everything you ever wanted to know about liches. It is the seventh volume in
the Complete Guide series. Each Complete Guide is exactly what it sounds like:
a complete guide to playing a given kind of monster. As a GM, you'll learn how
to run that monster, both in combat and role-playing situations. The Complete
Guide to Liches can be inserted easily into any fantasy setting.
