ARE YOU GOOD?<BR>...OR ARE YOU EVIL?<BR><BR>Darkness stalks the halflings of
this quiet and peaceful hamlet and aventurers must decide whether to help the
good residents or side with the forces of evil!<BR>The Hamlet of Thumble is a
basic adventure setting designed for a party of four to six good or evil
player characters (PCs) of 1st or 2nd level.<BR><BR>For Good PCs:<BR>The PCs
are sent to The Hamlet of Thumble to find out why the halflings have been
unable to pay taxes to the local lord.<BR>They soon discover that evil
humanoids are terrorizing the halflings who blame their lord for the lack of
protection from the nightly raids. Little do the adventurers know that by
helping the halflings they may serve as pawns in a game of politics and war...<BR><BR>
For Evil PCs:<BR>Evil PCs are humanoid raiders ordered to steal as much as
possible from the residents of The Hamlet of Thumble and hopefully cause enough
havoc to force the halflings to leave. This band of miscreants comes from a
tribe of evil humanoids that has settled nearby. The challenge for evil PCs is
tougher because the halfling settlement is larger and more sophisticated than
the evil humanoid one. The evil PCs must avoid Thumble's powerful NPCs while
doing as much damage as possible.<BR>Two groups of PCs can also work against
each other - one party of good PCs protecting the hamlet and one band of evil
PCs raiding it. There is an additional scenario in which two groups of evil
PCs, a group of evil humanoid raiders and a group of evil mercenaries, act
together to terrorize the halflings.<BR><BR>This product also contains
