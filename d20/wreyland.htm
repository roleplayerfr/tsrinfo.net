"I am Princes Athanake."<BR><BR>The woman who stands before you is
young and beautiful, attired in gowns of the finest green velvet, and
bearing with calm grace a circlet of gold upon her brow. She captures,
in the slightest gesture and inflection, a porcelain perfection that
you had once believed to exist only in storybooks and myth. She is a
princess.<BR><BR>"I wish that it were under happier circumstances and
calmer skies that I welcomed you to Anach, so that we might prepare a
royal feast and listen to your tales in better company. Unfortunately,
that is not to be, at least for now. Instead of telling tales, I fear
that I must ask you to make new ones.<BR><BR>"Three days ago Royal
Miners discovered the hidden lair of the Wreyland Serpent, a black
dragon who has ravaged our lands for as long as memory allows. All but
one of the men who worked there were savagely butchered by the creature."<BR><BR>
She delicately extends a hand to one side, and a waiting courtier
immediately steps forward and places a scroll within her grasp. The
princess, in turn, extends it to you.<BR><BR>"This is a royal decree,
sealed less than a quarter hour ago, giving you whatever lawful
authority is neccessary to prosecute our interests in this matter.<BR><BR>
"I beg you. Deliver my people from this beast."
