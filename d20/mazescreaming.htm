<center><b>Journey to the City of the Damned!</b></center><BR>High up in the
mountains called the Wall of the World, where the air grows scarce and the dome
of the sky draws close, one may find the cruel and mysterious Empire of Yagga
Kong. The Yagga Kong rule a vast domain of gorges, crags, deep hidden valleys
and desolate plateaus. It is said that they worship death and keep the bodies of
their ancestors in their homes with them. They know many horrible secrets, use
fantastical machines and fiendishly potent sorceries. No one really knows why
they are so cruel. Perhaps the thin air and cold has driven them mad or
perhaps it is the crazed Worm-Gods they revere - their realm is full of mysteries.<BR><BR>
The "City of the Damned" (it has no real name) sprawls at the feet of the
Yagga-Kong's most remote outpost, the so-called Last Redoubt. The City has no
real economy. It produces nothing, creates nothing. It only exists to cater
to the garrison of the Last Redoubt and to the adventurers who come to try their
luck in the Maze of Screaming Silence.<BR><BR>For hundreds of years the Yagga
Kong have offered a handsome reward to anyone who can enter the Labyrinth and
emerge again alive. The longer they remain inside, the greater the reward.
Every generation or so, someone lives to claim it. The Yagga Kong's motives
for doing this are unclear - apart from cruel whimsy, which may be sufficient.
it has been suggested that the Thing in the Labyrinth might get hungry if they
didn't supply it with victims, and that the contest is the cheapest way of
providing it with the sustenance and entertainment it craves.<BR><BR>Can you
brave the Maze of Screaming Silence? Then come walk the crooked streets of the
City of the Damned.<BR><BR>Warning: This book contains graphic depictions of
truly unpleasant things. Discretion is advised for younger and less
disturbed readers. Maze of Screaming Silence is a D20 Adventure and City
Sourcebook designed for 3rd to 4th Level Characters.
