<center><b>LIFE * DEATH * IN BETWEEN</b><BR><BR><i>The plague of all
living things is death, the beauty of horror inextricably linked through
poetry and art, knowledge and faith. It cannot be stopped. It calls
each of us with impunity. But death, by all, is still feared. Rumors
of a hellish afterlife shake the foundation of every religion. Often,
the spiritual core is challenged by one's own dependence on the flesh.
A fate worse than hell, a living damnation awaits those who challenge
the rites of the gods.<BR><BR>Yet still some seek eternity, delving into
the arcane lore of the darkest secrets. The gates between life and
unlife sunder under the blows of faithless men who forsake their souls
at the expense of the living.<BR><BR>Damn them all.</center><BR></i>
