<center>Common arcane lore divides physical existence in four basic
elements: Air, Earth, Fire and Water. By manipulating these elements,
arcane spellcasters create some of the most spectacular effects of
magic, raising walls of stone around them or raining fiery death upon
their enemies. Unlike druids, who control nature's resources out of a
pact of mutual respect, wizards and sorcerers master the raw elemental
forces without permission and, most of the times, even without
acknowledgement.<BR><RB>By blowing creatures away or breathing
underwater, all arcane spellcasters are elementalists in a way. Their
knowledge, however, is limited to the strictly defined effects of spells
they learn from the eight schools of magic. Beyond that basic knowledge,
there are those who dare to further their understanding of elemental
forces, eschewing their progress in the general arcane arts to walk the
Four Elemental Ways and gaining power over the building blocks of the
universe.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</center><BR>Elementalism -
