Draneken Castle recently withstood a massive invasion by the Barbarians
of Beloran Gorge. During the course of the fight, the court wizard,
the self-titled Keland the Magnificent, sent His Majesty King Ivol
Lareth II into hiding. Shortly afterward, however, Keland died. In
fact, he died before telling anyone what he did with King Lareth.<BR><BR>
Now, the King's unaccomplished son is ruling over Draneken and King
Lareth's trail grows colder. With all of their options exhausted, you
are the kingdom's last hope. If you can bring home King Lareth, the
wealth and gratitude of an entire kingdom is yours.<BR><BR>Keland, for
all his boasting, was still a rather shrewd charater as he made finding
King Lareth difficult. Your search begins in Keland's chambers in
Draneken Castle. Only a fool enters a wizard's chambers without an
invitation.
