Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
The cloister of the god of valor is under siege! A blackguard and his
devourer ally are leading an army of wights against the valiant paladins
who defend the cloister. The heroes arrive just as the siege begins, and
may be able to sway the outcome. But to do so they must explore the
cloister's ancient crypt, where a strange artifact holds the key to
defeating the blackguard and his unholy army...
If you enjoy this adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl Classics
series!
