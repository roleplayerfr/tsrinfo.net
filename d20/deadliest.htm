<b>Not Necessarily the Biggest...</b><BR><BR>Creatures, both good and bad,
come in all sizes and shapes. But oftentimes it isn't the largest and most
powerful creature out there that's the most dangerous. You can see the
tower golem from literally miles away, but it's the clouds of insects that
swarm you in the middle of the swamp or the flock of rodents scurrying
through the ruins that could mean death to your characters.<BR><BR><b>
...But Definitely the Baddest!</b><BR><BR>Deadly is the only way to
describe what you'll find within these pages. Sixty new and different
monsters, undead, extraplanar beings and more fill this tome, giving GMs
more options than ever before for populating their adventures. From the
tiny anakim and dreydnar to the incredibly massive sky squid, these
creatures each live up to the moniker "Deadliest Creatures" in their own
ways!<BR><BR><b>Make Your Players Earn Their Gold!</b><BR><BR>It happens
in every campaign sooner or later; the heroes get more powerful than the
monsters and villains that are supposed to challenge them. If your
players sneer at dragons, laugh at liches, and jeer at demonic hordes,
turn this fantastic assortment of horrors loose on them. They won't
know what hit them... if they survive!<BR><BR>Visit <a href="http://www.fastforwardgames.com/">

Player Characters or a powerful ally to aid them in their fight against
evil, there's something for you within these pages.<BR><BR><b>About the
