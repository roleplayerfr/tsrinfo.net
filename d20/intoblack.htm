The dark realms beneath the surface conceal an immeasurable wealth
of wondrous riches and terrifying mysteries awaiting discovery by
those daring enough to venture into these lightless kingdoms.
From dense veins of precious metals and mesmerizing, luminescent
crystals to unknown and seemingly alien species of plants and
animals, the deep places of the earth support a diverse and often
bizarre ecosystem utterly foreign to most surface dwellers. Yet,
tales of the subterranean world's magnificent treasures tantalize
brave adventurers seeking to wrest them from the clutches of the
wicked beasts and monstrous denizens that call this forsaken land
home.<BR><BR><i><b>Into the Black</b></i> prepares players and
GMs alike for the perilous quest into this inhospitable territory,
arming players with the tools necessary not only to survive in
this treacherous domain but prosper. Potent new substances, magic
items, equipment and material await underground explorers, while
a full arsenal of innovative spells aid them in their quest.
Likewise, <i><b>Into the Black</b></i> gives GMs a diverse
spectrum of potent monsters from the insidious and cerebral
pallemon to the sly and crafty barathelar as well as campaign
ideas and a complete background on each of the four subterranean
environments: caverns, catacombs, mines and sewers.<BR><BR>Requires
the use of the <b>Dungeons & Dragons</b> <a href="../3e/phb35.htm">
<i>Player's Handbook</i></a>, published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.
