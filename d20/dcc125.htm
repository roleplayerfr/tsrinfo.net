Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
Many centuries ago, a band of paladins fell from grace. These blackguards
were defeated after a great battle and their grim fortress, the Iron
Tower, was razed. A small abbey was established near the ruins, where
generations of monks mixed ancient eldritch wards, mighty clockwork traps,
and multiple failsafes to build the Iron Crypt of the Heretics. Three
mighty vaults ensured that the blackguards' evil would be sealed for all
eternity. But unbeknownst to the brotherhood, their impregnable crypt
had a single weakness: the very monks that had built it, for they knew its
secrets. When a devourer stole into their abbey, the profane beast forced
the monks to lead it inside the Iron Crypt. It successfully broke into
the first of three vaults, releasing an army of wights. The story of the
devourer and his wight army is told in <a href="dcc12.htm">
Dungeon Crawl Classics #12: The Blackguard's Revenge</a>. Now, in
Dungeon Crawl Classics #12.5: The Iron Crypt of the Heretics, the heroes
must venture into a crypt designed by the world's greatest thieves,
magicians, and seers, solve its puzzles and deadly traps, and seal it
once more from the outside world.<BR><BR>If you enjoy this adventure,
look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl Classics series!
