The stunning conclusion to the Horned Lord and Moon Sow Campaign sees the lands
of the Earth Goddess tribes under the heel of the reptilian Fomorians. It
seems one tyrant has been exchanged for another - one that is not even human.
Though the tribal druids counsel against it, the only way to defeat the sea
demons seems to be to take the path of the Horned God - uniting the obstinately
freedom-loving tribes under one High King who will bring back the true worhsip
of the Goddess.<BR><BR>With the assistance of all four tribes of the Earth
Goddess, players will have a chance to defeat the Drunes and their Fomorian
allies, for the other tribes can bring both more of the Teeth of the Moon Sow,
and the knowledge of how to quest for the remaining three great Treasures of
the Earth Goddess.<BR><BR>Requires the use of the Dungeons & Dragons <a href="../3e/phb.htm">
