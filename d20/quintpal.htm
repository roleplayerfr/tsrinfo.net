<center>Protect the innocent and uphold the law - these are the basic tenets and
the core definition of a paladin, one of the hardest character classes to
role-play, as they follow a straight and all-too-narrow path in the course of
their adventuring lives. Defending truth and justice against the endless attempts
of evil to subvert or destroy them, the paladin stands at the gate, holding the
bridge... and none shall pass.<BR><BR>With the help of this sourcebook, any
player choosing the paladin class will find many alternatives and options
expanding his range of abilities. Prestige classes offer paladins roads that
further explore their divine inspiration and absolute dedication to their cause.
New feats will hone the paladin's fighting prowess, as well as give him new
ways to use his divine abilites. New weapons, armour and equipment give any
paladin more tools with which to battle evil, while he can learn new tactics to
exploit the strength of his faith, his sword arm and his mission. The paladin's
sacred tools are also given more detail: from options for his faithful mount to
the power of holy weapons that unlock that power only for a noble heart.<BR><BR>
