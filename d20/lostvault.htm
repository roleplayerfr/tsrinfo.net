Remember the golden days of role playing, when adventures were underground, NPCs
were there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was the dragon on the
20th level? Well, those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics feature bloody
combat, intriguing dungeons, and no NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each
adventure is 100% good, solid dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the
traps you fear, and the secret doors you know must be there somewhere.<BR><BR>
In the Lost Vault of Tsathzar Rho, a simple expedition to rid a village of a
maruading ogre soon becomes more than it seems. A mysterious force has
transformed the ogre and the kobold tribe he once bullied into twisted,
demented creatures. When the characters enter the ogre's cave, they find a
passage behind leading deep into the mountains. Soon they arrive at the lost
vault of the sorcerer Tsathzar Rho. This extended dungeon crawl will advance
a party of first level characters up to third level.<BR><BR>If you enjoy this
adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl Classics series!
