<center>The gladiator is the highly trained master of arena combat, capable of
dispatching foes in the most spectacular maner imaginable. His highly
specialised training in such forms of combat as net-fighting, blind-fighting
and exotic weapons allow him to demonstrate the most unusual fighting
techniques in the world to an eager audience. As important as winning his
fight, he must win the crowd, the vast seething mob of the imperial cities.
<BR><BR>This is the second book of the Power Classes series from Mongoose
Publishing. Designed to be seamlessly slotted into any fantasy-based d20
system game, each of these mini-supplements introduce an entirely new core
character class, adding a whole new dimension to campaigns. Players will find
full details on how to use the new character class, greatly increasing the
wealth of options they are presented with by the core rulebooks while Games
Masters may revel in the wide variety of new classes they have at their
disposal for non-player characters in their campaigns. Each Power Class
booklet can provide hours of gaming enjoyment at an all new low cost.<BR><BR><b>
