<i>'Tis said of that ancient brooding forest that before the world
grew accustomed to the light of day, her stems had grown high and her
eaves dark and comtemplative. If ever those ancient trees pondered,
then they wondered on the creatures which have come from the Outlands
to slip beneath their shadowy canopies.<BR><BR><center>* * *</center><BR>
The Darkenfold swallows you in a sea of green. The tangles and briars
of the forest's edge have given way to the rough roads of the hinterland.
Giant trees with huge boles tower above you, cloaking you in a leafy
mantle. You know from tales that these woods are the haunts of the
famous Quagmire, a merciless rogue troll lord who, over his long career,
has left a trail of death and destruction beind him.<BR><BR>The
Mortality of Green</i> is a fast-paced adventure of pursuit through a
deadly forest. Quagmire the Troll Lord has stolen a sacred tree from
the Druidic Council. The evil troll seeks to plant the tree amid the
roots of his evil master, a decayed Sentient Tree from the Days before
Days. If the characters cannot stop him, the Darkenfold shall be
corrupted for all time.<BR><BR>This challenging d20 System adventure
for 4-6 characters of levels 3-5 needs heroes of quick thought and
even quicker action. Detailing the Darkenfold Forest in the World of
Erde, <i>The Mortality of Green</i> provides DMs with enough information
to run a mini-campaign of epic, sword and sorcery adventure.<BR><BR>
