<center><b>TOOTH * CLAW * FANG</b><BR><BR><i>My people have stood watch
over this land for centuries. There was a time when wars between our kind
and the ogres were commonplace. Savage, brutal campaigns left both sides
demoralized and broken, But, in one season, each would be prepared to
fight again. This was always the way of things.<BR><BR>The ogres have
moved on, but the need for watchful eyes has not passed.<BR><BR>Our
brothers are savage and warlike, but we are not. Our cousins make
enemies with everyone around them, while we stand vigilant and hopeful.
Our kin take offense at the slightest misunderstanding, provoking war
with nations twice their size and strength. It seems that no matter
where we live, conflicts arise.<BR><BR>Our hope is to find a place
where we belong and our children can live in peace.</i></center><BR>
