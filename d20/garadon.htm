<i>Special Note: This is a sequel to <a href="outofbody.htm">
Out of Body, Out of Mind</a>, published by AEG. The first adventure is
not required, but is recommended to take full advantage of the alternate
setting of Tirna'cel.</i><BR><BR>The legend of the realm of Tirna'cel is
well known. Once remembered for its power-mongering warlords,
homunculi-wielding sorcerors, and archfiends from the deepest pits of
the Abyss, Tirna'cel has become a powerful and welcoming land over the
last 600 years, due in no small part to the efforts of the warlord
Tirna'gael, a member of the land's founding nobility.<BR>But your party
knows the truth. You ventured into the Tomb of Tirna'gael some six
months ago, and therein discovered that the fallen warlord was actually
little more than his brethren: a petty, avaricious power-monger.
Possessed by a rival force which also desired the kingdom - a rare
incorporeal demon called a nescent, which inhabited his body and
augmented his already incredible power to unforseen levels - Tirna'gael
sought to overthrow the ancient warlords only to replace them.<BR>
Through Tirna'gael's augmented body, the nescent overwhelmed and
eliminated the other warlords, eventually dominating the realm alone.
But before it could consolidate its rule and throw Tirna'cel into an
even darker age, the secret of its power was discovered by the paladins
of Garadon, a virtuous cell of justice and light. The paladins lured
Tirna'gael into the center of his own fortress and trapped him there
within a powerful antimagic field. His body withered and died but the
nescent remained dormant, waiting for its chance for revenge.<BR>During
your visit to Tirna'gael's fortress-tomb six months ago, you accidentally
released the nescent from its prison. That enemy has since been
vanquished - at least for a time being - but the memory of your pitched
battle against it still lingers as you approach the original chapter
house of the Order of Garadon.<BR>You have been summoned.
