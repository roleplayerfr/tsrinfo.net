<center><b>It's Your Moon Now!</b><BR><BR>After generations of failed
attempts, the means to reach the myterious Moon of Luclin is once again at
hand. But beware - there are dangers beyond reckoning on Luclin, those
created by the Maiden of Shadows herself as well as those that have made
the moon their home-in-exile after escaping from Norrath. These are the
enemies you must defeat if you wish to claim the awesome artifacts of
Luclin as your own.<BR><BR><b>100% compatible with 3rd edition fantasy
role-playing rules</b><BR><BR>Adventures on Luclin are suited to characters
of all levels, and the monsters and villains contained herein reflect
this fact. From the lowly needle-clawed rock hopper and shik'nar
hatchling to the thought horror Overfiend and the rulers of the remnants
of bothe the Akheva and shissar races, this volume presents a wide-range
of foes suitable for use with 3rd edition and revised 3rd edition fantasy
role-playing rules.</center>
