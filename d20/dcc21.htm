Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
The coastal town of Argalis has been struck by three gale-force hurricanes
in the last three weeks. While the first two storms succeeded in
devastating the town, the final added insult to injury by destroying more
lives than property. Argalis' leaders know a local storm giant called
Stozari Stormbringer sent the hurricanes against them for failure to pay
her annual "good weather" tribute. Argalis' leaders want an end to the
storms, and they've decided the best solution is to eliminate the
giantess herself. They need heroes willing to storm her castle and kill
this tyrant once and for all!

Classics series!
