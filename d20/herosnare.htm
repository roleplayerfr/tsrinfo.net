<center><b>Revenge!</b></center>Kobolds. The lowest rung on the humanoid ladder,
the laughing stock of the adventuring community. They fall by the score, bleed
life after worthless life into the earth, good for nothing but fertilizer for
the grasses. They aren't "real" monsters; they're hardly even pests!<BR><BR>
Frankly, Thane Kithslek of the Clan Menziguai is bloody well sick and tired of
it. Being driven from their lands time after time, with hundreds of promising
young pups lost to the nasty-bright blades of human invaders, has finally
grown intolerable. It's just about time for the kobolds - those "pathetic,"
"weak," "useless," little kobolds - to show these human scum exactly what it
is they're dealing with.<BR><BR>And it is the province of Thessalaine, isolated
from the main forces of the King of Surrengol, still recovering from last
year's drow and orc raids against its capital city of Madradur, that presents
the most promising target.<BR><BR>Kithslek and his Menziguai kobolds are
putting the "crawl" back in the dungeon and your heroes may never laugh at
them again.<BR><BR><center>The Hero Snare is a d20 System dungeon crawl
suitable for characters of 7th-8th level.</center>
