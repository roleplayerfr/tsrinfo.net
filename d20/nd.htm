<center>Brothers, we have determined that somewhere out in the ether of
space there is another realms, a realm where those who live, breathe, and
sleep may very control the fate of out poor, misfortunate world. The
Brothers of the Watchful Eye theorize that our world is plagued by
creatures built upon nothing more than the dreams and nightmares of that
other world. But lo, before you scoff, think about the power and terror
of your own nightmares. In order to better understand and defend
ourselves from these creatures, we have begun to catalogue their habits
and powers. Brothers, we are truly at war with monsters and I pray to
all the gods to deliver us from this evil.</center><BR>Arch Priest of
the All Father, Miguel de Bivar<BR>Third Synod of Dunreth<BR><BR><center>
