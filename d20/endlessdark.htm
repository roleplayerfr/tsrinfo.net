<center><i>Life, in its abundance, never ceases to amaze. Even here, miles from
sunlight, in a realm bereft of green plants and nourishing rains, nature thrives.
Tiny, luminous fungi flourish in the footprints of a ravenening brath. Mystic
kezmarin frolic amid crystal chasms, while the massive golshuda ravages
dwarven strongholds. Indeed, life does not simply thrive down here: it shapes
the very stones we trod.</center><BR>-From the Journals of Bessimus Camfor</i><BR><BR>
This tome, the first in a series of guidebooks by the legendary Wanderers Guild,
is a collection of essays and expositions by renowned Minesweeper Bessimus
Camfor. Bessimus draws upon the experience and wisdom gained by decades of
exploration and danger to bring this comprehensive guide to life. Here you
will find detailed narrative and remarkable depictions of dozens of
subterranean beasts and the realms in which they thrive.<BR><BR>Beautifully
designed and illustrated by celebrated Guild illuminator Andy Hopp and translated
from Bessimus' original manuscripts by master scribe Jon Pollom, this d20
sytem monster manual is the foundation of a legacy designed to edify, inform,
and equip generations of explorers who would venture into the unlit realms of
earth and stone.
