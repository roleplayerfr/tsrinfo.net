<center><b>The Perfect Learner's Manual!</b></center><BR><i>Orcfest</i>
is the perfect start-up adventure for the new 3rd Edtion of the
<i>Dungeons & Dragons</i> roleplaying game. It's a rollicking quest
that culminates in a climactic battle against an orc war chief and his
army, paired with a step-by-step guide to character development, die
rolls, combat, and more. As you play, both the game master and the
players receive advice and hints to explain the game for first-timers.
Even experienced players will find tips for faster, more streamlined
play - tricks that took the rest of us many years to discover!<BR><BR>
<i>Orcfest</i> starts with a <i>Player's Guide</i> which the game master
can photocopy for players. It's more than a dozen pages about choosing
a class, buying equipment, interacting with NPCs, exploring the first
dungeon, mapping techniques, the basics of combat, game etiquette, and
much more. It includes several extended examples and many diagrams to
easily illustrate any aspect of the game. Additional pages are
targeted specifically at the game master with ideas to consider before
ever running that first game.<BR><BR>The adventure portion of the booklet
uses a unique layout to teach novice players and game masters all the
essentials. Instructive notes are presented right along with the
adventure material, providing valuable pointers for novice game masters.
Each new wrinkle of the game is accompanied by plenty of support
information - for example, the cryptic monster statistics block is
supplemented by an explanation of how to read the statistics shorthand.
The book introduces the game master to the game a little at a time,
starting with the basics and adding new layers.<BR><BR>Even with all
this instruction, the goal is to have fun! The adventure brings a novice
group of characters into a crisis in Solitude, a frontier town on the
human-orc border. The orc tribes are planning to attack Solitude
using a secret weapon, and the players must discover their plan and
find a way to stop it - by masquerading as vile orcs! The novice
characters have a chance to save the day and be named heroes, and the
players and game master gain a thorough understanding of the game
system.<BR><BR>Visit <a href="http://www.fastforwardgames.com/">
