The large golden skull is smoothed and polished from centuries of
handling. Legends say that its powers include the ability to alter
the weather, throw lightning bolts, and smite your enemies with holy
fire. You have spent years searching for it, following rumors and
traces of myth, until you found it at last. It is the key to your
future, the surest way to realize your dreams of power and influence.
Yet even as you struggled to unlock its secrets, it was stolen from
your possession -- taken from you by a bunch of thieving butchers and
carried off to their lair.<BR>Well, you are not going to let them get
away with it this time! Not when you were so close. Oh no! This
time, you are going after it... and you are not coming back until you
retrieve The Giant's Skull.<BR><BR><center>This product contains two
fantasy adventures.<BR>The first scenario is designed for four 10th-level
characters. The second is for 5th-levels Ogres.<BR><BR><b>There are
two sides to every story!</b></center><BR>Turn the tables on standard
fantasy adventures! Not only can the players portray the heroes who
must retrieve a valuable artifact from the brutish ogres living
nearby, but a second scenario can unfold where the players take on the
parts of the ogres, attempting to punish the human raiders once and
for all!<BR><BR><center><b>Pregenerated Ogres and full color counters
are included.</b></center>
