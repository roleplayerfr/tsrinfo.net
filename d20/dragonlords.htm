<b>FOR TEN THOUSAND YEARS</b> the bright empire of Melniboné ruled the
world. Her soldiers were ruthless, unspeakably cruel, and skilled at
arms. Powerful sorcerors, magic came easily to them, as easy as
breathing. They forged eternal bonds with the aloof gods of Law and
Chaos, with the hideous demons from other planes, with elemental lords
who are of the world itself, and with the ancient dragons with which
Melniboné enforced her might.<BR><BR>But wealth and age has dulled the
Bright Empire, tarnished its beauty, and weakened its people. The
empire rots from within. And outside, young kingdoms arise on the lands
Melniboné's sons and daughters carved from the stuff of chaos. These
kingdoms are ambitious, and envious of the ancient wealth of their
former masters.<BR><BR>A pirate navy is forming, to sail against the
Dreaming City of Imrryr. Its captains hope to recapture stolen riches
and to bring a hated overlord to ruin.<BR><BR><b>DRAGON LORDS OF
