Sky ships, flying castles, cloud cities, and airborne monsters: all this and more
awaits you in the Aerial Adventure Guides. These stand-alone sourcebooks contain
new character options, races, monsters, feats, items, and adventure ideas,
plus aerial combat rules and sky ship design guidelines. Best of all, the aerial
adventure guides can be integrated into any fantasy campaign - after all, no
matter what world sits at ground level, anything can float above.<BR>The series
is divided into three volumes. The first covers rules, the second cover
settings, and the third covers monsters and items. Each of the three volumes
can be used independently, or they can be combined and used together.<BR><BR>
Volume Two, Sellaine, Jewel of the Clouds, describes a variety of drop-in
settings for aerial adventures. The main attraction is the sky elves'
floating city of Sellaine. Nestled in a cloud far above the surface world,
Sellaine serves as the nerve center for a vast economy in the sky. Surrounding
it are unusual aerial locations: floating mages' towers, undead clouds of
necromantic energy, and other unique hazards. Features:<BR><ul><li>Intricately
detailed setting of Sellaine, an ancient cloud city on the cusp of enormous
change.<li>Drop-in location of Dreadfall, a powerful cloud of necromantic
energy.<li>Drop-in location of Fulgash's Tower, a long-abandoned wizard's
tower that floats through the skies at a 45<sup><font size="-1">o</font></sup>
angle.<li>Drop-in location of the Wildlands, a sentient cloud realm that is in
itself one massive artifact.<li>Stats for all important NPCs and maps for all
important places.</ul><a href="aag-rulers.htm">Volume One, Rulers
of the Sky</a>, covers the basics of aerial adventures. <a href="aag-monsters.htm">
Volume Three, Monsters, Magic, and Sky Ships</a>, includes everything you need to
populate the sky lanes of your campaign.
