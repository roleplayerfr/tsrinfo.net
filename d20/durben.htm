Steal the Nanoc from the Whimpering Depths and the prince promises to meet
you in the town of Durbenford, a sleepy community overlooking a crystal
clear lake, sparkling waterfalls, and one of the most successful logging
operations known in all the lands. Is your party brave enough to face
off against the clicking and shrieking horrors of this mysterious complex?
Can they be trusted with the Nanoc once they find it? Something is wrong
in Durbenford, something terrible. The Nanoc is just the beginning.<BR><BR>
