<center><b>The Adventure Continues!</b><BR><BR>In the aftermath of the war
for Caldraza, a mysterious messenger brings news that the drow threat has
by no means been wiped out and a retaliatory strike could come at any time.
Meanwhile, powerful friends await the call to arms in the city of Crom
Calamar, the unconquered capital of Jehannum, Nation of Warriors. But
when Crom Calamar's battlements fall and her streets are plunged into
darkness, the whole of Ashfar is thrown into turmoil and the heroes of
Caldraza are thrown centre stage, as the fate of the entire world falls
upon their shoulders.<BR><BR>In distant Xoth Sarandi, the Crossroads of
the World, Ashfar's diplomats covene and it is there that the heroes of
Caldraza must make their stand against the combined might of kings to
unite the free nations against the drow.<BR><BR>First, though, there is
an ocean to cross, and strange secrets brood in its depths. The menace
of the maelstrom is not the mere ocean hazard that it appears and the
pirate tribe called the Sea Harriers prove to be more than just a band of
oppurtunistic brigands. Legends tell of sunken cities far to the south,
but not all such cities remain submerged when there are deals to be made
with ancient creatures from times before mankind arose.<BR><BR>Despite
the danger of the ocean passage, Xoth Sarandi must be reached, for only
there, amid the politicians and assassins, can new friends provide
welcome help. Tired of their government's endless neutrality, a conclave
of powerful elven mages reveals the secret to breaking the drow's dark
spell, directing the heroes into the most icy and remote corners of
Ashfar and from there, on to worlds darker and more sinister.<BR><BR>The
long journey towards a final confrontation with the drow takes the heroes
of Caldraza from embattled cities of the free world to distant peaks
where only dragons dwell, in their quest to hold counsel with kings and
lead armies to death. Whether the heroes or their enemies prevail
remains to be seen; nothing is predestined and no answers are certain.
Failure is always a possibility, for without the threat of failure, there
can be no true reward in victory.<BR><BR><i>The Drow War: Book II - The
Dying of the Light</i> is second in a series of three 256-page books.
Each one containing a single epic story, all three tied into one
overarching saga. These adventures are designed to take the characters
concerned from 10<sup><font size="-1">th</font></sup> to 20<sup><font size="-1">th</font></sup>
level.<BR><BR>RECOMMENDED FOR GAMES MASTERS ONLY</center>
