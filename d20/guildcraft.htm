<b>Guilds of Prestige</b><BR>Until now, there has been little reason for
adventurers to give guilds a second thought. While often seen as places to find
goods and services or hirelings, guild can form the backdrop for exciting
adventures on many fantasy worlds where power and prominence in shaping
nations, cities, and cultures depends on the guilds and money. Much excitement
and itrigue can lurk among the shadows and rooms of the guildhalls, as those with
secrets and coins quickly learn....<BR><BR><b>Guilds of Power</b><BR>Guilds hold
strengths and influences hardly available from dragons' lairs or the darkest of
dungeons. Guildcraft details the powers and priveleges of guild membership,
as well as new knowledge and details on the underpinnings of your d20 worlds.
Adventurers of every class and skill have new oppurtunities for both
enlightenment and profit. <i>Guildcraft</i> is written from a world-neutral
standpoint for wasy placement into any fantasy world.<BR><BR><i>Guildcraft</i>
requires the use of the <b>Dungeons & Dragons</b> <a href="../3e/phb.htm">
