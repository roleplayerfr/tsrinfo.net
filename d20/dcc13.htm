Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
This special tournament module was used for the First Annual Dungeon Crawl
Classics Open Tournament in at Gen Indy 2004. The module includes the
official tournament scoring system and pregenerated characters, as well
as almost two dozen illustrated player handouts. An ancient prophecy
sends the heroes into the crypt of the Devil Lich to destroy her before
she can return to power. Once inside, they must face horrors that could
only be dreamt of by a mad half-drow half-fiend lich!
If you enjoy this adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl Classics
series!
