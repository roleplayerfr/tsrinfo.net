<center>There are many curious things in the world and not only are gnomes one
of them, but they are determined to find out about the rest. They toil in
their burrowed workshops and laboratories, churning out wonders that range
from a cure to mummy rot to the ultimate salt shaker. Their inquisitive
nature and innate restlessness always push them forwards, even if 'forwards'
leads straight to a ravine because, who knows, maybe there is something
interesting at the bottom?<BR><BR>A good-natured approach to every problem
seems to be the way of gnomes. Always ready to laugh at their own misfortune,
they roll up their sleeves and get to work to resolve them. Where others see
a closed box, gnomes see a wooden wrapping for something potentially exciting
and caution be damned: <i>they</i> are going to open it!<BR><BR>The Quintessential
Gnome offers players a comprehensive guide to playing characters of this
class that will prove to be invaluable for characters of any level from 1<sup><font size="-1">st</font></sup>
to 20<sup><font size="-1">th</font></sup>.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</b><BR>
