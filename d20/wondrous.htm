<i><b>Most magical of all, the wondrous items...</b></i><BR><BR>Deep in
the recesses of a cob-webbed basement lie the collected artifacts of an
entire wizard college's many teachers. The plundered treasures of a
dozen worldly adventurers is stashed here, piled in heaps or dumped in
crates of bags. None of the professors have time to inventory the
dust-covered trove, so naturally, they leave it to apprentices. 'Count
everything and make a detailed list so we can find things later on,'
they order the young wizards, but warn, 'most of what you find won't
kill you, but some of it might, so be careful what you touch and how
you touch it!'<BR><BR><b><i>A wealth of wondrous items at your fingertips!</i></b><BR><BR>
