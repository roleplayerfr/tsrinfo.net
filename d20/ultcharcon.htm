Character concepts are not simply about adding to a character's
abilities. In many respects they are the character; or at least
the germ of that character. Even the Man With No Name, a
mysterious drifter who saves whole towns from evil, has a nugget
of characters that statistics and skills cannot quite capture.
he is not just another renegade who can fight - as soon as he
walks into play, everyone knows he has a unique, if shrouded,
background. This is the core of character concepts, the reason
for their success, for they are the starting point of an
adventure. Even before the characters meet, each can have a core
vision and attitude from the very beginning of play. Character
concepts are about roleplaying - the only reason for the benefits
and penalties given in every case is to properly flesh out how
these particular individuals would be slightly - or substantially -
different from others of their kin.<BR><BR><center>This product
