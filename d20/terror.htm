As dangerous as the darker parts of the city can be, an uneasy peace
has settled over the twisted hive of scum and villainy known as
Freeport. Despite evidence of a sinister cult of serpent people
masquerading as humans, walking the city's streets, the Sea Lord of
Freeport has barely lifted a jeweled finger to actually solve the
problem. As evidence mounts that a powerful evil is at work (above and
beyond Freeport's normal residents, that is), it is up to your heroes
to uncover the snake men's sinister plot and trace the lines of power
that lie behind it.<BR><BR>Return to Freeport, city of adventure and
intrigue in this sequel to Green Ronin Publishing's hit <b>d20 System</b>

This adventure, perfect for characters of levels 2-5, provides you with
everything you need to further explore the shadowy back alleys and
creaking docks of Chris Pramas' grim and gritty fantasy city. Along
with a deadly tale of action, investigation, and intrigue, within
these pages you'll find information on the Captain's Council and the
power structure of Freeport, adventure hooks for continuing adventures,
and four pre-generated characters, so you can get right down business.<BR><BR>
<i>Terror in Freeport</i> is the second chapter of the <b>Freeport
Trilogy</b>. The events set in motion in the first two parts of this
saga come to an action packed climax in 2001 with <a href="madness.htm"><i>
