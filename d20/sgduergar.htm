<center><b>Deceit and Treachery</b><BR><BR>The duergar, often called grey dwarves,
live well-hidden in the darkness of the cold ground, revelling in mischief and
evil deeds of all sorts and despising their cousins still living on a surface
world now forbidden to them. Once a mysterious people, more has been discovered
about their way of life, and sages hope that with the information provided by
their texts one will be able to understand the intrinsic nature of these creatures
and be aware of the danger they represent.<BR><BR>Duergar are masters of treachery
and deceit and are engaged in an everlasting struggle with the other races of
the underdark in their search for dominance over those realms. Drow are their
fierce competitors in this domain, but duergar have surrounded themselves with
such ingenuity that even dark elves have learned to respect them as capable
adversaries. Duergar retain much of the dwarven race's traits even if their
metabolism has changed somewhat to adapt to their environment, and their
communities have evolved into a well-oiled fighting power to be reckoned with.
Duergar are not to be taken lightly. They are cunning and intelligent and,
most of all, can be very unpredictable.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</center><BR>
