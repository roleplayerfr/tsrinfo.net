<center><b>ARE YOU READY TO GET MEDIEVAL?</b></center>The <i>Medieval
Player's Manual</i> gives you everything you need to have exciting
adventures in the age of Christianity and crusade. This is not Hollywood
medievalism, but the real thing. The <i>Medieval Player's Manual</i> has
been exhaustively researched to provide rules that reflect the actual
beliefs of the period. <i>Ars Magica</i> line developer David Chart has
written a book that is both authentic and playable. Take your d20 game
back to the Middle Ages with the <i>Medieval Player's Manual</i>. The
book includes:<BR><BR><ul><li>Three new magic core classes (cunning man,
natural magician, and theurge) and two support prestige classes
(necromancer and theopanist).</ul><ul><li>New systems for medieval magic
like folk charms, alchemy, astrology, astral charms, and theurgy.</ul><ul><li>
Three new religious core classes (priest, canonist, and saint) and five
supporting prestige classes (crusader, templar, prelate, hermit, and
mystic).</ul><ul><li>The introduction of Charisms, new feats representing
gifts of miraculous power granted by God.</ul><ul><li>Rules for holding
academic disputations, creating theories, and writing books.</ul><ul><li>
Non-combat core classes like scholar and artist.</ul><ul><li>Overviews of
the Christian Church, the political history of the time, philosophy and
the arts, and medieval laws and beliefs.</ul><ul><li>Suggestions for
alternate campaigns, like the Abbey Campaign and the Court Campaign, and
intriguing historical "What ifs?".</ul><ul><li>Backgrounds and stats for
important people of the day, like Empress Matilda, Archbishop Anselm of
Canterbury, and natural magician Adelard of Bath.</ul>The book also
presents <i>Kin of the Conqueror</i>, a campaign setting detailing the
anarchic period after the death of King William the Conqueror. From 1087
to 1154 the British Isles and northern France were convulsed by wars over
his legacy. Plunge into adventure with <i>Kin of the Conqueror</i>, or use
the rules to explore other parts of the medieval world. Either way, the
<i>Medieval Player's Manual</i> is your starting point for a new d20
experience.</td></tr><tr><td><BR></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFDDAA">
