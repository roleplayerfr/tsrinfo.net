<center><b>The Sea Devils</b><BR><BR>For those that live far from the
sea the sahuagin are unknowable creatures of the deep, used by parents
as bedtime cautions to wilful children. Or perhaps they are told of
around the campfires by adventurers, their tongues and imaginations
loosened by mead, in electrifying deeds of bravado. These deeds are the
product of an alert mind and an ear for a good story, for few away from
the gentle lapping of the briny sea have ever met, let alone bested, the
sahuagin and lived to tell such a rollicking tale.<BR><BR><b>Inside You
Will Find:</center><BR>Sahuagin Physiology:</b> Discover the sahuagin's
amazing natural senses and their ability to track blood scent through
over a mile of ocean. Great concentrations of blood in the water drive
them into an unstoppable frenzy that lays waste to their enemies.<BR><BR><b>
Habitat:</b> Delve deep into the sea to find an entire kingdom hidden
from the eyes of the surface-dwellers.<BR><BR><b>Sahuagin Society:</b>
Never before seen information on how the sea devils endure day-to-day
life. The relgion of the sahuagin drives their culture and society,
arranged into an unholy trinity dedicated to the annihilation of all
life but their own. Here you will find full details on the sahuagin
Royal Guard and the High Priestess prestige class.<BR><BR><b>Methods of
War:</b> Though crippled by exposure to air, sahuagin are nevertheless
a lethal enemy, able to lay waste to entire coastal settlements.
Beneath the waves, they are truly without equal.<BR><BR><b>Role-Playing
with Sahuagin:</b> Games Masters are provided with complete information
on who to portray sahuagin within their campaign, in a way players will
never forget.<BR><BR><b>Scenario Hooks & Ideas:</b> A series of jumping
points to introduce sahuagin into a campaign, in a manner that reflects
their unqiue way of life and style of fighting.<BR><BR><b>Sahuagin
Village:</b> A complete lair for sahuagin - a small part of an immense
undersea kingdom, but a place lethal to any surface-dweller.<BR><BR><b>
Sahuagin Reference List:</b> A ready to go list of characters and
enemies for players to face, should they ever dare venture into the
domain of the Sea Devils.<BR><BR><center>FOR GAMES MASTERS AND PLAYERS
