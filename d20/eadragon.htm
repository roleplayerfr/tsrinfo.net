<center>Every wizard, sorcerer and bard knows deep within that his abilities are
a pale imitation of the true power that dragons embody, and every new avenue of
research is an attempt to find the original path of magic. Dragons continue to
practice their arts, looking at the mortals trying to reach beyond their own
limits with amusement, worry or admiration. Some of these magnificent beasts
even teach their craft to those whom they deem worthy but they must do so with
care, lest the weight of the lesson break their mortal pupils' minds.<BR><BR>
Even if they stumble in the dark, spellcasters have a spark that can be
funnelled into a raging fire and they are able to reach in the span of decades
what many dragons will not learn in a couple of centuries. The power of dragon
spellcasting attracts these magic users nonetheless, who seek to understand
why the great magical reptiles can harness magic with such natural talent.<BR><BR>
Dragon magic, or dracomancy, groups the disciplines that arcane spellcasters
have discerned from their study of dragons. From wresting the hidden meanings
behind the Draconic language to tapping into the residual magic in dragons'
bodies, they search for the key to the dragons' might. There is still no mortal
spellcaster who can claim to have mastered all, and thus achieved the pinnacle
of dracomancy: to wield magic as a dragon.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</b><BR><BR>
