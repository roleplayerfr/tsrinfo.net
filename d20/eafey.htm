<center>The fey - also known as faerie, or fair folk - are some of the
most misunderstood creatures in fantasy games. Some view them as
harmless sprites living in the depths of sylvan woods; others see them
as vindictive creatures with limitless power who steal children and
play cruel and even lethal pranks on those that cross their path. The
truth, as might be expected of such an enigmatic race, is that both
perspectives are sometimes accurate, although there is far more to the
fey than either view would suggest.<BR><BR>For those looking deeper
into the mysteries coiled around the fey, another area of speculation
is the magic they wield. In some cases it seems quite innocuous, while
in other circumstances it is nearly unstoppable in its destructive
force. The fey are understandably quite protective of their gifts and
the source of these powers. All that most mortals have been able to
learn is its name: the Reverie.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</center><BR>
