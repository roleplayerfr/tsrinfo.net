When the Slarecians captured the goddess Drendari, they tore the secrets of
shadow magic from her and passed that knowledge on to their servants, the
Penumbral Lords. But the Penumbral Lords betrayed the Slarecians and stood by
as the gods defeated their masters. Centuries later, the Penumbral Lords live
on, and the most infamous of them is the dark elf known as Dar'Tan. Leader of
the evil Penumbral Pentagon, Dar'Tan sought to conquer the city of Mithril from
within. Defeated by the paladin Barconius, Dar'Tan escaped with his surviving
followers and founded the Penumbral Fortress, from which he continues to plot
and scheme.<BR><BR><b>The Penumbral Pentagon</b> details the history of the
shadow-worshippers, unlocks the secrets of the Penumbral Fortress, and provides
full statistics for Dar'Tan and his new Penumbral Pentagon, ready to challenge
even the boldest and most
