<center>Chaos is glorious. Chaos reigns supreme. The sheer power of chaos
is limitless - and the strength of those who wield it is equally unbounded.
Chaos is not so much the absence of order as the presence of infinite
permutations of order, of possibility, each complete in and of itself and
awaiting the moment, be it brief or eternal, when it will impose its
structure on reality.<BR><BR>The chaos mage is the ultimate architect of
this imposition, changing the fundamental nature of reality to what he
wishes it to be. The chaos mage is the antithesis of the wizard and the
sorcerer. While their magic is all complex formula, rote recitation and
memorisation, his magic is freeform and limitless, like chaos itself.
For the chaos mage, there is no such thing as the impossible, merely the
improbable. Their art is a magic of universal potential, of destruction
and building, beginnings and endings. In short, chaos magic is the stuff
of creation. Now, that magic is yours to command.<BR><BR><b>Inside You
