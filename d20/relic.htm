<center><b>POWER * MAGIC * WEALTH</b><BR><BR><i>The weight of the world is focused
on this mere bauble.<BR><BR>Forged in the ancient days before the gods walked
the worlds, none can say who crafted it, nor to what purpose. But none can
argue with its power. Thirty wars have been fought over it. The lost continent
of Mlar sank into the sea as the result of its power. Tyrkas the Undefeatable
put to lie his title when he attempted to claim it. Thousands dead. Tens of
thousands more homeless, widowed, orphaned. Cities in ashes. Unbound hatred
rules the world, and war touches every last corner of the land. All for one
small device.</i></center><BR><BR>-Ulthas the Unifier, Royal Sage of Tyrgos<BR><BR>
<center><b>THE GREATEST MAGIC OF THE AGES</b><BR><BR>Artifacts are mightiest
enchanted items of the cosmos. Imbued with the power of a god, a legion of
devils, or the ambition of a single mortal, they can bring justice and hope to
all... or herald a new era of darkness. This book presents dozens of new
artifacts, complete with game rules, histories and backgrounds, enough to
satisfy the most demanding fantasy campaign.<BR><BR>The artifacts presented
here are far more than simple collections of game statistics. After all, an
artifact is more important than the mere rules that govern its use. Each comes
complete with a background story, ideas regarding its current use and location,
and adventure seeds for creating campaigns or encounters involving the
artifact.<BR><BR><b>A LIFETIME'S WORTH OF ARTIFACTS</b><BR><BR><table cellpadding=10>
