<center><b>AN ANCIENT EVIL AWAITS</b><BR><BR>Troglodytes are a thoroughly
foul reptilian race with all the chill mercilessness and cruelty of a
cold-blooded snake. Many consider them to be as evil as the most
loathsome of demons. Troglodytes inhabit the underdeep of the world for
they are creatures of the dark but may also be found in the rocky peaks
and passes of desolate mountains. These few tribes who live near the
surface wage a constant war on nearby settlements during cold, moonless
nights.<BR><BR>In the past many Game Masters have simply used Troglodytes
as sword fodder for adventuring parties. Their skill with javelins,
foul scent glands and chameleonic ambush abilities combined with large
numbers make them truly lethal opponents. Up to now they have rarely
been treated with the depth and detail such a race deserves. With
this book, everything changes.<BR><BR>FOR GAME MASTERS AND PLAYERS ALIKE<BR>
