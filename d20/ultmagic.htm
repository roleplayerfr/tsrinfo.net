<center><i>Ultimate Magic Items</i> is a complete guide to the construction, uses
and effects of magic items. Not only does it present a plethora of magical
objects, weapons and artefacts to add spice and depth to a game, but the wider
effects of magic are also considered. Enchanted objects may be a source of
unity or a cause for division, help society function or allow a tyrant to
dominate. They may even make possible a civilisation where none could otherwise
exist.<BR><BR>Games Masters and Players alike will benefit from a greater
understanding of how magical items shape and change society. By using the items
presented in <i>Ultimate Magic Items</i> in unusual ways, Players can squeeze
the last drops of utility out of a random find or a seemingly trivial item.
Characters can learn how to derive political or economic advantage out of
objects they might otherwise sell or leave at home as less than useful.<BR><BR><i>
Ultimate Magic Items</i> is an encyclopedia of magic that no serious adventurer
can be without - but more than that, it is a source of new strategies, applications
and underhand tricks involving magic that can make the difference between
heroic success and ignominious failure.<BR><BR><BR>This Product Requires the use
of the Dungeons and Dragons <a href="../3e/phb35.htm">Player's Handbook</a>,
Third Edition, Published by Wizards of the Coast.<BR><BR>FOR GAMES MASTERS AND
PLAYERS ALIKE</center>
