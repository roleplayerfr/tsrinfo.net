When you read the posting for this job, you knew what you were getting
yourself into.<BR>"Lady of means requires assistance of a stalwart
group of adventurers willing to undertake a mission of utmost importance.
Discretion is required."<BR>Words like that never mean that the woman
in question is looking for someone to weed her garden - unless, of
course, it's full of man-eating plants. Those are the words you only
post if you're really in a bind. If it's a matter of life and death.
If you're desperate for help and willing to pay for it through the nose.<BR>
It just so happens that you've made yourself quite a reputation lending
just that kind of aid to people in just that kind of need. And the
money hasn't hurt you any either. So when Lady Elena Zadrian tells you
that her father - the near-legendary alchemist Sir Timoth Zadrian - has
gone missing, well, you're not all that surprised.<BR>Lady Elena looks
up at you once again, brushing the long, blonde hair from her bright
blue, tear-soaked eyes. "My father lives outside of a village only four
day's ride from here, a sleepy, little place called Cuthder," she says.
"He comes to see me every four months. He's a forgetful, old man, but
I could set my clock by his visits." She chokes back a sob.<BR>"It's
been eight months since I saw him last. I fear something has gone
horribly awry. Either brigands have robbed his tiny castle, or one of
his experiments may have left him dead - or wose."<BR>The lady stares
you straight in the eye, and you can almost taste her desperation. "My
father is a good man, wise and noble, but if word of this disappearance
were to get out, it would hurl my household into a shambles. I need
you to travel to his castle and learn for me what has happened to him,
quickly and quietly.<BR>"Please," she begs of you, her ruby-painted
lower lip beginning to quiver. "I need your help. And I'm willing to
pay - handsomely."<BR>She has your attention.
