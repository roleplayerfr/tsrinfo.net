<center><b>Evil Cunning</b><BR><BR>Pound for pound, muscle for muscle,
bugbears are stronger, sneakier and far more unpredictable than their
other goblinoid cousins. They are brutal guerrillas who strike fast and
fade away, bursting onto the scene to wreak terrible havoc before
vanishing. If they could ever unite under a single banner, or maintain
the military discipline of the hobgoblins, they would shake the heavens
with their rage. Fortunately for the rest of the world, bugbears are as
fractious as they are violent, driven by chaotic urges and consuming
greed that prevent them from developing the social structure of more
advanced races.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</center><BR>Bugbear
