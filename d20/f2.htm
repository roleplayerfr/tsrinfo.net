<center><b>A Vault of Unspeakable Terrors</b></center><BR>Eons ago, the
world was held in the grip of fear by the dark city of Krezzel Dul and its
dark master: Osenkej, the Witch King. Though this great evil was finally
defeated, some portions of the city -- the Ebon Fane -- remains buried
deep underground. But worse is what lies deeper: beneath the Fane is the
Black Vault, wherein reside numerous artifacts and creatures of great
and unimaginable evil. Now, a dark army known as the Ghul Legion seeks
to plunder these vile treasures - if they are not stopped, the horrors of
the Witch King will be free again!<BR><BR><center><b>A Race Against Evil!</b></center><BR>
Fane of the Witch King is an epic, open-ended adventure designed to take
a party of 4th to 6th level characters to 10th level or beyond. Far from
an ordinary dungeon crawl, Fane of the Witch King challenges characters to
move fast and strike hard against a multitude of challenging and intelligent
enemies while they navigate through a versatile and dynamic multi-area
dungeon. Includes a new spell and several items of evil power including
the Blood Grail and the Bone Cross.<BR><BR><center>Requires the use of the
