<center><b>A Harsh Mistress</b></center><BR>She has suffered a civil war
among her favored race: the Akheva. She granted a home to those who fled
Norrath and the vengeance of other gods: the shissar. She accepted those
who fled their own civil war on Norrath and sought a new home in the
heavens: the Combine Exodus. And she indulged the explosive arrival of
those torn from the face of Norrath when the Underfoot and Paineel clashed:
those kerrans known as the Vah Shir.<BR>Yet the goddess Luclin remains
undaunted and her namesake moon unconquered.<BR><BR><center><b>An Entire
Moon to Explore</b></center><BR>All the great cities, every corner of the
vast wilderness and wastelands, populated or pristine, and every known
cave and dungeon of the moon Luclin is now at your disposal. Presented
for the first time is all the lore and chronlogy of this moon, from the
Akhevan civil war through the first Norrathian incursions and on to the
present one, which has brought new generations of adventurers and explorers.<BR>
Can these new heroes penetrate the airless region known as the Grey, where
the shissar empire still thrives? Can they survive the Ring of Fire,
where captives battle for the amusement of the evil grimlings? Or, most
frightful of all, are they so valiant they might risk the terrible wrath
of Luclin herself, plundering the ancient treasures in the crumbling
Akhevan city of Vex Thal?<BR><BR><center><b>100% compatible with 3rd
