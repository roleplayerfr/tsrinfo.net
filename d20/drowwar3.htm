<center><b>The Adventure Reaches Its Climax!</b><BR><BR><i>The Drow War:
Book Three - The Darkest Hour</i> begins on the world of Ashfar, where a
peace forged in blood has been bitterly broken. Something is causing the
barriers between worlds to collapse, smashing plane into plane, opening
rifts through which atrocious fiends can step into the ordinary world and
cause chaos. Even former enemies recognise the threat. Is it written
in the heavens that the Starborn and the drow must always be opposed or
can the dark ones truly change? Can the olive branch be accepted or is
it just another trick?<BR><BR>In the haven of a dead god's skull,
infernal and heavenly creatures meet to determine the fate of the worlds.
Faced with a gathering of strange and sinister individuals from across
the planes, the Player Characters must choose their allies well. Can
these ancient enemies possibly act together and prevent the coming
catastrophe or will the Player Characters stand alone against the Dark?
With the debris of shattered worlds serving as incontestable proof that
whole planes have already been destroyed, the race is on to find the
powers behind it. The dust is blown off old books and legends are
ransacked for information. There are at least three items that can work
this kind of magic, but which - if any - is the artefact responsible?<BR><BR>
There is only one way to find out. <i>The Drow War: Book III - The
Darkest Hour</i> sends the epic Player Characters upon quests that would
balk even the greatest heroes. These quests lead through worlds of ocean
and forest into fortresses where forbidden things creep in the dark,
through storms of chaos and under skies of impossible colours, and
ultimately to a showdown whose result will determine the fate of all
worlds.<BR><BR><a href="drowwar1.htm">The Drow War: Book I -
The Gathering Storm</i></a> saw the Player Characters save nations.
<a href="drowwar2.htm"><i>The Drow War: Book II - The Dying
of the Light</i></a> saw them save the world of Ashfar. Now, in <i>The
Drow War: Book III - The Darkest Hour</i>, they must save a million worlds.
The fate of the cosmos rests in the hands of the Starborn and those they
choose to ally with. Only one thing is certain...<BR><BR>Whichever path
the future takes, whichever side is victorious, this is the final battle
of the Drow War.<BR><BR><i>The Drow War: Book III - The Darkest Hour</i>
