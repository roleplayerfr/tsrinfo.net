Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
The city is gripped in fear! The Ripper has returned after a 125-year
absence and is once again carving a trail of blood through the slums of
Millers Court. Also returned is the ghost of Mari Kell, his last victim
from more than a century ago, and she haunts the streets where she was
killed. The city watch is at a loss to solve this supernatural mystery,
much less apprehend the ripper himself. All the clues point back to the
hovel where Mari Kell was slain long ago. If the heroes are brave enough
to enter, will they find the Ripper himself there?
<BR><BR>If you enjoy this adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl
Classics series!
