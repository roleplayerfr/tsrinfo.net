<center><b>Kiss My Axe!</b><BR>Immerse yourself in Celtic myth. Based on the
legendary 2000 AD comic strip saga created by Pat Mills and Angela Kincaid,
Sláine is a brand new d20 role-playing game giving you background on Tir Nan Og,
the Land of the Young in Celtic legend and full rules for playing the various
characters found there. The innovative skil-based magic system lets all
characters cast a spell or two if they wish, reflecting the superstitious
beliefs of the Celts. Channel earth-power through your body, swelling to a
monstrous size as you enter a warp-spasm. Learn the secrets of the feared
gae bolga, a barbed and spiked spear which always causes fatal wounds, or hurl
the dreaded tathlum, a concrete ball made from the brains of your dead enemies.
Battle shoggey beasts, skull-swords and fomorian sea demons for the honour of
your tribe. Enrage your enemies with the power of your poetic insults alone.
Or throw subtlety aside and wield a flint great-axe, slaying fifty foes to the
left of you and fifty to the right. You will not think it too many.<BR><BR><b>
Inside you will find<BR><BR>Characters in Tir Nan Og</b><BR>A complete guide
to creating characters for use in the game - the mighty warriors and heroes
of the Land of the Young, druids both wise and evil, cunning witches, and
wily thieves.<BR><BR><b>Feats</b><BR>Over 40 new feats give you the chance to
learn Salmon Leaps, Shield Growls and other Celtic battle techniques.<BR><BR><b>

Without Life, Sundered Heads, and Piles of Carcasses</b><BR>Run mass battles of
every size from a tribal cattle raid with just a hundred or so warriors on each
side, right up to a full-scale Fomorian invasion of the Land of the Young.<BR><BR>
