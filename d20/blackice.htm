<b>Terror Reborn!</b><BR><BR>Buries deep beneath the earth, beyond the
haunted and malign forest known as Wormwood, lies Black Ice Well. Once
a temple devoted to the Sajaith demon clan, the Well is now a cold and
haunted tomb, rumored to be replete with mutant brood and undead horrors.
But the greatest terror of the Well is not what guards it, but what
they are protecting - the cremated remains of Shae Mora, the dreaded
and legendary vampire dragon who once terrorized an entire Empire.<BR><BR>
Now, the secret of what transformed the Well to its current state is
about to be revealed. Sammael Mezias Craven, a dark wizard of vast
power and endless ambition, has uncovered an artifact that will allow
him to take control of Shae Mora's liquid remains, the Blood Ice, which
legend states still holds potent remains of her vast power.<BR><BR>If
he is not stopped, Craven's actions will bring terror and destruction
to the surrounding lands, and perhaps the world at large. Only a band
of the most stalwart and capable heroes stand a chance of preventing
this from happening, and to do so they will be forced to travel to
the edge of madness.<BR><BR>And beyond...<BR><BR>Black Ice Well is an
epic d20 System dungeon crawl designed for 6-8 characters of 13th-14th
level.
