<center><b>NEW IN TOWN?</b></center><BR>No more generic innkeepers! Out
with the bland blacksmith! Now <i>Seven Cities</i> brings you a
wealth of vibrantly populated places to use in your D20 System fantasy
campaign. Whether you're looking for a convenient refueling station
after a hard day of plundering the local dungeon, a circumspect place
to pawn hard-fought-for riches, or a quiet little town to call home,
<i>Seven Cities</i> provides communities chock full of politics and
intrigue, love and hate, life and death.<BR><BR><i>Seven Cities</i>
features:<BR><BR><ul><li>An introduction offering rules and insights
for generating fantasy cities of your own, delving into the politics,
commerce, geography, history, power centers, and population that make
a city come to life.</ul><ul><li>Seven discrete chapters each detail a
specific size of city; a thorp, hamlet, village, small town, large
town, small city, and even a large city are all described not only with
dozens of maps, but also with unique personalities that guarantee PC
interaction.</ul><ul><li>Later chapters refer to earlier ones, so that
some of the inhabitants of the thorp show up in each of the larger
communities, playing similar roles in every instance. This makes it
easy to pick the size of the city you want and make use of as much of
<i>Seven Cities</i> as possible.</ul><ul><li><i>Seven Cities</i> is
also designed to help tailor any city to work better in your campaign;
add new life to it, and let it throb with the pulse of the people who
make it their home.</ul>Like all Penumbra products, <i>Seven Cities</i>
is written to provide you with material adaptable to any fantasy
campaign, whether it be a published setting or a world of your own
creation!<BR><BR><center>Requires the use of the Dungeons & Dragons
