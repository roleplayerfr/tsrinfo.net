<i><b>A</b>t the time of Christ, a legendary culture was on the rise in northern
Europe. Two millennia later they would be remembered for their reverence of
nature, their treatment of women, and their courage in battle. Had they been
allowed to expand and grow, they might have had their own Golden Age and Western
culture might be very different today. Instead, they met the Romans, who eventually
conquered them all. This magnificent people was the Celts, and this is their
story.<BR><BR>This volume explores their culture. Find out who they were, what
they held holy, the monsters they fought - both real and mythical - why they
battled each other, and what gave them joy. In addition to providing tons of
detailed material on the Celts, this book allows you to bring them into your
d20 campaign. A host of new Character Classes, Feats, Skills, and other new
rules, makes this the definitive book on fantasy role-playing in the Celtic Age.</i>
