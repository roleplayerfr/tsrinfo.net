Welcome to the past that never was. OGL Ancients is a role-playing game set
in a world long past, where Greek heroes do battle with hideous monsters
and artificers work mechanical miracles, while priests petition the Gods
for their divine intervention. Witches weave spells in secret glades
under the full moon and the spirits of the dead really do revisit the
living and wicked spectres lurk in the pestilent places of the earth.
This is an environment that many will not have ventured into before.
Instead of taverns, castles and dungeons, the setting is one of great
temples, amphitheatres, pyramids and hanging gardens, where wise or
corrupt kings rule over their sprawling empires and wars are fought for
the hand of one beautiful queen.<BR><BR>Set before the rise of the Roman
Empire, OGL Ancients focuses on the two most influential civilisations of
the ancient world, the Egyptians and the Greeks. Drawing upon historical
depictions of weapons, armour, equipment and societal structure of other,
more fantastical and mythical elements, such as the wrangling of the Gods
and the emergence of colossal monsters in keeping with the strong fantasy
of this heroic golden age of myth.<BR><BR>If you have ever wished to sail
with Jason on the Argo, to dare the labyrinth in the footsteps of Theseus
or to twist men's bodies into the shapes of swine like Circe; if you would
besiege the white walls of Troy or fly amid the clouds on winged sandals.
If you would learn the secrets buried in the hearts of the pyramids meet
with the witches on lonely mountains then venture forth as something
greater than the Iliad is born...<BR><BR>The world of OGL Ancients is one
where true heroes are remembered forever and where a man favoured by the
Gods can rise from the humblest of beginnings to command the world.
