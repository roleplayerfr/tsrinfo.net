<center>You wish to study enchantment with me? Are you certain you understand
what it is you ask? The school of enchantment specialises in a very powerful
but very personal form of magic, making people, place and things affect the
minds of other in ways that can be very intimate indeed. With this magic you
can make someone fall in love, pledge devotion to a task, or defend a place
with his very life.<BR><BR>Enchantment, by its nature, is an elitist art. One
cannot be set apart from others by magic, like an enchanter is over those
ensnared through charms and compulsions, without becoming a little distant.
Good enchanters try to use this magic responsibly. Evil enchanters revel in
their ability to enslave others and force their will upon the world.<BR><BR>
Enchantment truly is a fire in the mind. Harness its power or prepared to
get burned...<BR><BR><b>Inside you will find:</center><BR>Usurping the Will:</b>
A detailed study into the world of the enchanter, including prestige classes
and ideas on how to develop and explore the powers at his command.<BR><BR><b>
Spells of Enchantment:</b> Presenting a host of new spells for enchanters and
other spellcasters, including a new line of spells targeted at those creatures
charmed and controlled by the magics of enchantment.<BR><BR><b>Enchantment
Feats:</b> Specific feats aimed at further expanding the options and ideas for
the development of enchanters and enchantment based magic.<BR><BR><b>Thralls:</b>
Once a victim has had its will shattered by an enchanter, it can become a
mind-bound thrall under the permanent control of its master.<BR><BR><b>Magic
Items:</b> New magic items to aid enchanters in disguising their school
specialisation or expanding on their options and powers.<BR><BR><b>Help for
Games Masters:</b> How to make use of this book in your campaigns, including
rules for mental trauma for when the will is stretched too far.<BR><BR><center>
