Archipelagos flock there to enter the service of rich merchants of the

just an adventure, The War of Shadows lays the founation of an epic
campaign.<BR><BR><HR><BR>Are you ready for the tempest of terror soon
to wash over the Archipelagos!<BR>A different kind of d20 product -
translated from Oriflam's French language La Guerre des Ombres.
