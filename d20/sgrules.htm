<center><b>A Fiend in Human Form</b><BR><BR>Rules-Lawyers are an
unexpectedly hardy breed of disgusting humanoid (at least in physique)
creature. To all outward appearances they are a normal human being,
like you or me, and it is only by their strange behaviour and very
close (often post-mortem) physical examination that they are reavealed
to be anything other than Homo Sapiens. Scholars are in agreement that
Rules-Lawyers have been around at least as long as games of any kind
have existed.<BR><BR>Some go as far as to say they have existed as long
as rules themselves have existed in this universe. They are said to
have lived among us, alongside man and his more primitive and slope
headed ancestors since time itself began, waiting for them to lose
interest in football and develop the wheel.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will
Find:</center><BR>Physiology:</b> It is a dirty job but someone has to
do it. Our team of experts have dissected a Rules Lawyer and made some
disturbing discoveries. Includes the acclaimed Wandering Poontang
Table.<BR><BR><b>Habitat:</b> There are few lairs more recognisable
than that of the Rules Lawyer. Find out just where they are likely to
be found, and how to avoid them.<BR><BR><b>Rules Lawyer Society:</b>
It is hard to believe, but Rules Lawyers actually congregate together.
Such an unholy meeting can only have the direst of consequences for
normal gamers like you or I.<BR><BR><b>Methods of Warfare:</b> Be
prepared. Here we give you a full arsenal with which to combat the
dreaded Rules Lawyer.<BR><BR><b>Role-Playing with Rules Lawyers:</b>
It can happen to the best of us. A Rules Lawyer makes his way into
the gaming group and refuses to leave. Here we have a look at how to
co-exist with this feckless creature.<BR><BR>And introducing the Rules
Lawyer character class, together with unique spells and feats!<BR><BR>
