<b>THE STORM CLOUDS GATHER</b><BR><BR>As the adventurers are beset by a torrential
storm they must take refuge in a secluded village. Seidel, a small hamlet, is
tucked into the ominous shadow of the Karster Mountains. Unfortunately the
Mountains are not the only thing casting a dark pall over the population.<BR><BR>
The people of Seidel are besieged by the raging storms and a host of curses.
Their livestock is devoured by an unseen beast. Bandits skulk among the roads.

unliving haunt the woods and scream of their agonizing existence. No help is
to be had, for no one has survived leaving the village.<BR><BR>The adventurers
must unravel the mysteries cloaking the village as their lives depend on it.
For, once they enter these lands, they will be hard pressed to survive the dark
and stormy night.<BR><BR><i>An adventure in the d20 system for characters of
