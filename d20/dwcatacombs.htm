<b><center>Revisit A World Of Deadly Adventure Between Life And Death!</center><BR>
Behind, Beneath and Between...</b><BR>...the levels of the Nex and Kerse, the
Enemy Capital, lie the Catacombs. Listed on no map and rarely visited by even
the Caretakers' servants, the Catacombs are home to the degenerate, the
dejected and the derided. Rarely does one find the Catacombs - they find you!<BR><BR>
<b>A Hell Among Hells!</b><BR>This is not a place for the meek of heart or
those who fear all that is dark and evil. Heroes have come, but have rarely
left. Each of the Catacombs is worse than the last. They can be explored by
those brave enough, or foolish enough, to try, but never mastered. They are
the depository for the hopeless and the helpless - those too pitiful for even
the Nex - but especially for the heartless.<BR><BR><b>The Place Even Gods
Fear...</b><BR>...for one of their own is imprisoned here. It is a place that
the gods send their unwanted, and even those from among their own number who
can no longer be trusted. Trapped here within the Catacombs with no hope of
ever escaping, powerful gods and demon lords have made realms anew for
themselves. But how long can they remain cooped up before the pressure builds
up too high?<BR><BR>Visit <a href="http://www.fastforwardgames.com/">
