<center>Among the mysteries of the sea, Stormhaven stands proud and
defiant, a city built upon the relic of an unknown civilisation. Four
great pillars support a disk of preternatural stone, its architects an
enigma as great as the means of its construction. The new inhabitants
settled centuries ago, giving the city its current name because of the
solidity and endurance it offers against the surrounding ocean is
undeniable. Settlers erected their own dwellings on top of the disk
and, when they crowded it too much, engineered a floating city lashed
to the four pillars.<BR><BR>Magic is the lifeblood of Stormhaven,
coursing through its very foundations and making life comfortable away
from the shores of any nation. Its staunch neutrality ensures that
the riches keep flowing, making Stormhaven into a monument to
unfettered greed and hunger for power. It is the destination of choice
for the most ruthless merchants, crime lords and politicians, where a
silver tongue, quick wit and a fast blade are invaluable commodities,
both on the lowly docks and the glittering palaces. Any adventurer with
the right combination of ingenuity, strength and daring will find that
Stormhaven embraces him like a lover and that no dream of wealth, no
matter how extravagant, is beyond his grasp.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will
Find:</center><BR>Stormhaven - An Overview:</b> Stormhaven is a
free-floating, artificial island of white stone held three hundred feet
above the sea by four great pillars, each a quarter mile in circumference
and covered with ancient runes. Discover its history, government and
laws.<BR><BR><b>Upside:</b> The pinnacle of Stormhaven, the wealthiest
residents live on a platform high above the ocean, far beyond the concerns
of the wretched beneath.<BR><BR><b>Driftdowns:</b> Some would say this
is the true city of Stormhaven. Under the constant shadow of the
mighty disk above, almost anything can be found in the Driftdowns - for
a price.<BR><BR><b>Sailors, Soldiers and Scoundrels:</b> Many
illustrious personages make Stormhaven their own. Learn about the
movers and shakers of this great and majestic city.<BR><BR><b>Sailors'
Tales:</b> Few truly believe the tales of sailors who have journeyed
from Stormhaven but for the adventurer, they prove almost irresistable.
Legends and rumour are rife in the City of a Thousand Seas, and all
manner of strange characters make it their home, in possession of
highly exotic spells, magical items and feats.
