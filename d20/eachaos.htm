<center><b>The Power of Creation</b><BR><BR>Chaos magic is not for the
faint hearted - those unwilling or unable to maintain the daring or
force of will necessary to harness great, unwieldy energies will find
themselves destroyed by the very power they sought. The true unfortunates
will end their days locked into forms never meant for mortal eyes, let
alone mortal flesh. Many are the failed practitioners of this art, and
their wildly deformed bodies and warped minds serve as living testament
to the dangers inherent in tampering with the basic forces of the
universe. Yet there is no shortage of those willing to throw themselves
into the teeth of the storm, hoping against hope they will be the one
legends speak of, the master of wild forces, a true Chaos Mage.<BR><BR>
This volume of the Encyclopaedia Arcane series gives players and Games
Masters alike the information they need to begin using chaos magic
within their campaign. You will find chapters devoted to those who
dare to tap into this primal energy, the methods used to channel
primal chaos and information about the marvels and horrors of the Paths
of Chaos. New feats, magic items and character types are also introduced
to aid and hinder the neophyte chaos mage and his static magic
counterparts.<BR><BR>FOR GAMES MASTERS AND PLAYERS ALIKE<BR>Requires the
