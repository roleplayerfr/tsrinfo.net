<b>D</b>row; the dark elves. Banished to the Underdeep millennia ago by
their surface cousins, they plot, scheme and struggle for survival.
Beautiful yet wicked, brilliant and deadly, the drow are the knife in the
dark, the threat in the deeps.<BR><BR>Since the drow were introduced to the
roleplaying world some 25 years ago, they have become both favouritues of
many Games Masters and terrible foes to uncounted parties of Player
Characters. Sadly, over time they have also become overused and
oversimplified. There is no mystery to them any more. Players known
exactly what to expect from an encounter with drow and exactly how to
cope with it. Games Masters find themselves saddled with innumerable
clichés and presumptions about the drow, making one raiding party just
like any other, one drow city just like all the others.<BR><BR>Which is
where we come in.<BR><BR>Within these pages, the reader will find that
the drow are as complex and vibrant as any inhabitants of the surface
world, for this book is dedicated to the drow and to exploring all their
varied wicked splendour. In the millennia since the drow were forced
underground in the Great Betrayal and dispersed throughout the Underdeep
in the Sundering, the intense pressure of life beneath the surface have
caused them to change dramatically. For years, they have been though of
as a sophisticated and cruel race, governed by an even crueler
spider-woshipping matriarchy with absolute power over every drow. The
truth is not so simple and arrogant adventurers who set out beneath the
surface of the world, certain they know the full measure of the drow,
will find themselves quite unpleasantly surprised.<BR><BR>Within <i>The
Tome of Drow Lore</i>, Games Masters will find information on a variety
of drow cultures, religions, societies, Houses and even sub-races. In
addition, there are new drow spells, feats and drow equipment, of magical,
alchemical and mundane natures.<BR><BR>For those interested primarily in
the archetypal spider-worshipping drow, they are certainly covered, as no
book on drow would be complete without them. They are not the sum total
of the drow, however. Scattered throughout the Underdeep, the dark elves
have adapted to and been altered by their strange and hostile environment.
Centuries spent in isolation from one another have given rise to a
variety of cultures and beliefs. Games Masters interested in putting an
entirely new spin on the drow may forsake the usual culture altogether
with such options as the savage and brutal Kanabraun, insular Sulzthul or
the martial Lorgreln who have divorced themselves entirely from their fey
roots.<BR><BR>Give the drow a new lease on life in your game, with the
Tome of Drow Lore.<BR><BR><center>RECOMMENDED FOR PLAYERS & GAMES MASTERS
ALIKE</center>
