<center>Conjuration, the art of calling something forth from nothing, is a magic
of infinite potential due simply to its very nature. To conjure is to reach
past the empty spaces of this world and summon the heart's desires from beyond.
this kind of power can not be overstated or underestimated. To master
conjuration is to never be alone, to never face a situation without aid. When
one can instantly surround themselves with protectors, one mage can become an
army at a whim.<BR><BR>Historically, conjurers have often been treated with
awe, reverence and a mixture of fear and respect. Unfortunately, the best
known conjurers have made the school infamous by virtue of their chosen
summoning. Those who summon the infernal and abyssal beings of the nether
realms are only a small subset of this art, their controversial creatures have
burned the image of a hellish sorcerer consorting with demons into the minds of
the populous. While this narrow stereotype is ridiculous, it remains a
hurdle for any honest conjurer to overcome.<BR><BR>Conjuration is so diverse;
it even incorporates elements of many other schools into its spells. The
primary magic of conjuration, the set of summon monster spells, binds the
creatures called to the caster's will so tightly he could send them
unflinchingly to their deaths. Magical force, usually the province of
evocation, can be called into being by conjurers as well. With this kind of
flexibility, the school of conjuration offers incredible potential.<BR><BR><b>
