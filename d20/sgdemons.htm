<center>Evil, chaos and destruction; deprivation, insanity, unmitigated
cruelty. Pain, horror and madness. The ultimate incarnations of darkness,
this is what demons embody. As malignant as a necromancer or a demonologist
may become, they are still no match for the limitless evil of the lowest
dretch. There is no redemption for these outsiders, as they seel only the
destruction and corruption of all that exists.<BR><BR>Within these pages
you will find a wealth of information concerning demonic essence, the
Abyss and other haunts where these creatures thrive and the brutal
society in which they exist, giving an additional level of understanding
on how these outsiders interact with the rest of the world. Players will
learn how to detect and eradicate demonic influence on the Material Plane
and the perils of taking the fight into the depths of a demon's home.
Games Masters are presented with guidelines on how to introduce these
foul creatures into their campaigns. They will also benefit from material
demonstrating how to actually portray demons to their players, thus giving
their campaigns and scenarios much greater depth.<BR><BR>Demons fight an
eternal and brutal war to impose chaos and darkness upon everyone and
they have an eternity to wage it.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</b><BR>
