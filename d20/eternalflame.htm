The night is cold and recent adventures have left you without companions.
Here, at the Inn of the Green Wind, you seek further glory and adventure.
This nightm however, you find neither. Just a bard composing tales.<BR><BR>
He pulls out a pipe and lights it, sending ribbons of smoke to the
rafters of the inn. Pictures appear within the smoke, weaving an
intricate story of a lamp that flames eternal. As you sit enthralled,
your head begins to throb and your body goes numb. Tunnel vision sets
in and just before unconsciousness claims you, a woman's voice echoes
clearly in your mind. "Now you shall have your vengeance my love."<BR><BR>
Waking, you find yourself sitting in a dark, rank, rat infested cell.
Strangely, you cannot remember what landed you in this fine predicament.
You hear the sharp sounds of metal boots descending a spiral staircase
just outside your dungeon cell. The cell door unlocks and bright
light streams in, blinding you. A loud voice asks you to step out.<BR><BR>
"We have work for you."
