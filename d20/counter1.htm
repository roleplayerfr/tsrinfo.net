<center><b><u>USING THE COUNTERS</u></b></center><BR>
<b>Counter Collection I: The Usual Suspects</b> contains a large set of
colored counters to aid in tabletop conflict resolution. These counters
are based on a 1-inch equals 5-foot scale. Therefore, medium-sized
creatures occupy a standard one-inch square counter. Before beginning
play, carefully remove the counter pages and punch out the perforated
counters.<BR>The counters come in two types: characters and monsters.
Character counters provide a blank space at the bottom for the
character's name. For game purposes, the arrow in the top left corner
indicates the direction that character is facing. Monster counters
have a small arrow in the top left corner indicating direction, as well
as a blank square at the bottom right, allowing the GM to assign
numbers to multiple monsters of the same type. For example, the party
may encounter four bugbears, which would be numbered 1 to 4. The GM
can then keep track of the individual hit points and actions according
to which particular bugbear is involved in the resulting combat.<BR>
Monster counters are not labled with monster type, as many characters
may encounter creatures for the first time and out-of-character knowledge
of the monster may prove to be an unfair advantage. The GM should use
this to his or her advantage. For instance, rather than saying, "You
encounter four bugbears," the GM might say, "You encounter four large
goblinoids," then place the appropriate counters on your battle grid
for the players to see the picture.<BR>When you play with a Fiery Dragon
adventure, you bring more to the table!
