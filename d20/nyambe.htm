<b>LAND OF THE OVERPOWER</b><BR><BR>Nyambe is a vast land of exotic
creatures and wide expanses, where ancestral orishas cry for brave
warriors to carve out the hearts of foul mchawi wizards, and where
dragon-blooded sei sorcerers once joined the fierce Amazons of Nibomay
in the bloody Rebelling Time to win their freedom. This campaign
setting for the D20 System brings together high fantasy and African
myth, legend, and history.<BR><BR><i>Nyambe: African Adventures</i>
includes:<BR><BR><ul><li>Twelve new human cultures and six variant
non-human races, like the brown-skinned, tailed Wakyambi elves who
meddle in the affairs of men from the depths of the bida Rainforest.</ul>
<ul><li>New PC class variants and prestige classes change druids into
n'anga shamen who worship the natural orisha spirits and are as comfortable
in the skin of a panther as in humanoid form.</ul><ul><li>New skills
and feats like Ancestral Blessing, Drum Dancer, Elephant Warrior, and
Fire Blood are the heritage of every Nyamban, as well as new weapons,
armor, and equipment designed for a climate where the heat of the
vast savannah is more dangerous than an enemy's spear.</ul><ul><li>
Mortals who honor the spirit of orisha are granted new spells and
domains such as Darkness, Exile, Fertility, Lightning, and Plague.</ul><ul><li>
Mad mchawi wizards contemplate the contents of mojuba bags to prepare
their ominous spells, and new magic items like zombi powder turn
fallen warriors into true zombis that keep a hideous memory of their
former lives; ritual masks let the wearer become an orisha, and vodou
nkisi statues hurl powerful curses at those who dare to use them.</ul><ul><li>
Creatures never before seen by the men of the tamed north prowl these
lands... and ravenous beasts of the jungle and desert are only the
beginning of the danger that awaits those who walk the continent of
Nyambe!</ul><center><b>Requires the use of the Dungeons & Dragons
