<center>The drow are evil. Sundered from their surface brethren for sins
against the world, the drow have nurtured their hatred for centuries,
developing new and more exotic types of evil. From their horrific
ovarisites used in the gestation of their children to the arachnurgical
rites used in their brands of despicable magic to the dark secrets of
fleshcrafting, the drow have created evil all their own. Lurking below
the surface, they brood over the fates of their enemies while formulating
new types of magic and developing new martial skills. Ancient, decadent,
and thoroughly vile, the drow are the ultimate enemy of any who earn
their ire.<BR><BR>This volume in the <i>Quintessential</i> series presents
the drow in all their hellish glory, revealing for the first time their
practices from birth to death and beyond. Contained within these pages
you will find the secrets of the drow, enabling Games Masters to create
dark elf villains or players to design the drow characters of their
darkest dreams.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:<BR><table cellpadding="5">
