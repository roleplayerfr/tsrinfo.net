<center><b>The Greatest Mortal Wizard is Mortal No More!</b></center><BR>
The proud Erudite wizard Al'Kabor admits no mortal to be his equal in the
ways of spellcraft and magical power. Though few would dare dissent from
Al'Kabor's opinion, there are those who whisper behind his back that his
claim may be true, but only because the one who was the greatest of mortal
wizards is no longer mortal. The conflict - som say, con<i>test</i> -
between the Erudites and the kedge is legend, but the battle has died
down since the great kedge sorcerer Phinigel Autropos was trapped in his
underwater keep.<BR>Or, rather, it's believed he's trapped. If he isn't,
as some suggest, might not his designs for the surface world begin in the
lands surrounding his home, in the wilderness near Dagnor's Cauldron?<BR><BR>
<center><b>100% compatible with 3.5 edition fantasy role-playing rules</b></center><BR>
This sourcebook details the past and present of this dynamic region, which
saw the birth of three races (elves, dwarves, and kedge) and the
near-annihilation of two of them.<BR>The dwarven city of Kaladim and much
of western Faydwer are described in detail herein, as well as two complete
locations for adventures: the haunted Estate of Unrest, where the undead
battle one another for the right to leave those accursed lands; and the
home of the last of the kedge, Phinigel Autropos - Kedge Keep itself.
