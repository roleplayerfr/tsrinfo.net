Lord, Nyrathoth</b><BR><BR>These are but a few of the legendary wizards who
learned their art in the halls of Vundara. Some were champions of the weak
and oppressed. Some were heralds of doom and despair. Some were virtually
forces of nature unto themselves. All were undisputed masters of the arcane,
and it is the hope of joining their ranks that draws students in droves to
the wizard-city.<BR><BR>Vundara, the city of magic, rumored to be the
birthplace of wizardry, rests in the foothills of the Faeforn Mountains. It
is here that legend claims the titans taught magic to the young race of
elves. The art they learned eventually crafted the towering spires and
marble halls of Vundara. Labyrinthine libraries and ancient tomes hold the
true power of the city: knowledge. The magic houses vie for prestige and
influence. The games they play are acts of subtlety and spectacle that
strike awe in the uninitiated. One must master both the art and the
politics of wizardry to take a place among legends.<BR><BR><center><b>Requires
