Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
Odd things are happening in the area around Mount Rolnith, a dormant
volcano. When spellcasters wield fire magic, they feel drawn to the
mountain. Local farmers and their animals disappear, leaving clawed
footprints and signs of struggles. Open flames tilt, all pointing to
the same spot: a cave in Mount Rolnith's craggy face. The heroes decide
to investigate these occurences, and a torch serves as their compass,
pointing directly towards the cave's mouth...
<BR><BR>If you enjoy this adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl
Classics series!
