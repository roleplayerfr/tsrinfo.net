<b>The Battle of Everafter</b><BR><BR>The war between the light and the dark
has been waging for millennia, drawing mortals and other creatures from
throughout the planes into its armies and leavingnothing but bloody fields in
its wake. More than eighty major angelic beings and lesser celestial races are
detailed within these pages, each having played a part in this great war.
Further, eight new prestige classes, representing the most devout followers of
the greatest angels, are included, giving you the chance to create powerful
and dedicated characters unlike any others.<BR><BR><b>Assistance From On High</b><BR><BR>
Angels have long been considered the messengers of the gods, those who deliver
proclamtions from on high and dispense justice upon the impertinent. But they
are far more than just nameless creatures of light. They are powerful beings
in their own right, with their own concerns and their own methods. Not all
sit on high among the angelic choir. Many travel the planes looking for evil
to combat while others subtly direct mortals in actions against those dark
powers.<BR><BR><b>Gifts from the Forces of Light</b><BR><BR>Every angel is a
powerful being in its own right, but some possess power and station greater
than even some minor gods. With that power comes throngs of mortal followers
and a responsibility to lead the faithful in the battles to come. A few of
these powerful angelic beings have even deigned to bestow a bit of power to
some of the most devout and pious of their followers. Will your characters
be the next one chosen?<BR><BR>Visit <a href="http://www.fastforwardgames.com/">
