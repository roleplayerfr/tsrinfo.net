<center><b>A deadly hunger lies in wait...</b></center><BR>Deep in the heart of a
burial mound lies the form of an ancient Alchemist; the corrupt widow of a
long-dead <i>daimyo</i> lord who has remained immersed in a crystal bath filled
with the <i>essence of divine wind</i> - a liquid distillation of divine <i>ki</i>
energies - for a millennium in order to gain perfect immortality. But now a
group of wandering heroes is called upon to overcome her undead <i>jikininki</i>
minions, a band of rampaging barbarian raiders, and relic seekers who would
unwisely plunder the grave, before the depraved Alchemist is forever transformed
into a living god!<BR><BR><i>Lean and Hungry</i> is a D20 System Japanese-flavored
fantasy scenario for a party of 4th to 6th level. It includes:<BR><BR><ul><li>
New wondrous items like the <i>vigilant lantern</i> that reveals the infernal
nature harbored by those its light touches; the <i>amulet of the sheltered
mind</i> that wards against the effects of enchantments; the <i>amulet of the
watchful eye</i>, created to be the central piece in a magical scrying
system; and the <i>sands of timing</i> that measure the precise temporal
flow of arcane energies and processes</ul><ul><li>New spells such as the <i>
wand of ravenous hunger</i>, that curses grave-robbers with an all-consuming
hunger; and <i>bless salt</i>, which hinders the spawning of undead creatures.</ul><ul><li>
New potions like <i>essence of the divine winds</i> that harvests <i>ki</i>
energies to transform its user into an undying divinity; and the <i>
distillation of quickened stone</i> that hardens the rock it's applied to and
causes it to grow lighter</ul><ul><li>The blasphemous <i>rod of jikininki
control</i> that allows its user to bind these perverse monsters to her will</ul><ul><li>
Two new NPC classes: the criminal who makes up the bulk of both urban criminal
outfits and rural outlaw bands; and the faithful who serve their gods in
inglorious ways, much as adepts fulfill wizardly roles among primitive peoples</ul><ul><li>
New creatures such as the flesh-eating <i>jikininki</i>, the four monstrous
guardians of the ancient burial mound, a lesser shield guardian construct
charged with protecting its wizard master, and an army of miniature terracotta
soldiers!</ul><center>Requires the use of the Dunegons & Dragons <a href="../3e/phb.htm">
