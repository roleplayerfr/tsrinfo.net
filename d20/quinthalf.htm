<center>The smallest and humblest of the races, halflings often go
unnoticed in the grand scheme of things. It is this obscurity that is also
their strength, for fate often turns on factors that go unnoticed until
the last moment. It is in these moments, when the whole world seems to
hold its breath that the halflings arise to greatness. From the fields
and hedgerows, from the alleyways and burrows, from garden and shadow,
the little folk emerge to fulfill their destinies.<BR><BR>Unlike many of
the other fantasy races, the halflings are not a composite from built from
different mythologies, but spring from a small handful of clear sources.
Halflings therefore have a rich, coherent background to draw from, but
lack the varied breath of other races. Every halfling adventurer, regardless
of class, will find their place in this book. The naïve but determined
aventurer, the beguiling trickster, the lethal assassin, the cryptic
fortune teller, the master chef, the wise old crone, the undetectable
thief; all these halfling archetypes and more can be found within these
pages.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</b><BR><BR><table cellspacing="5">
