Lord Jingoro has been many things in his past. While he was but a youth,
the voices of his ancestors guided and supported him. As a man, he fought
with unparalleled skill and valor. As a general, he led armies to
victory in the emperor's name. As a daimyo, he has faced treason, famine,
plague, and war, battling each in turn.<BR><BR>Never before has Lord
Jingoro known fear. His ancestors have always granted him their strength
and wisdom. Regardless of the nature of his turmoil, these great
spirits have always stood beside him. Until now.<BR><BR>Nightmares
plague Lord Jingoro - nightmares of his ancestors meeting their ends,
not as the histories say they did, but as cowards and men without
honor. As he sees each of this idols topple one by one, his own resolve
founders. Soon his enemies realize his weakness, and exploit it to
their own ends.<BR><BR>As madness dogs his footsteps, the daimyo calls
upon his most loyal servants to aid him in uncovering the mysteries of
his ancestors... and undoing their most tragic mistake.
