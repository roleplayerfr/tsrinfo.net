August 2000, Green Ronin released the adventure <a href="freeport.htm"><i>
Death in Freeport</i></a> and kicked off the d20 phenomenon. But this ENnie and
Origins Award winning adventure was just the start, continuing with <a href="terror.htm"><i>
Terror in Freeport</i></a> and climaxing <a href="madness.htm"><i>
Madness in Freeport</i></a>. All three adventures have been out of print, but
no longer! The <i>Freeport Trilogy</i> is back and better than ever. To
celebrate the 5-year anniversary of Freeport, Green Ronin is proud to present
the entire trilogy under one cover for the first time. Each adventure has been
updated to the 3.5 rules and revised and expanded to make the campaign more
detailed and complete. It's time to return to the city that started it all.

heroes find themselves stranded in Freeport, a great trading city and haven of
pirates, cutthroats, and adventurers. A seemingly simple job plunges them into
them into the strange underside of the city, where they uncover secrets worth
dying for. Digging deeper, the heroes face countless terrors, learn of an
ancient race of serpent people and trace the history of the island on which
Freeport stands. But the deeper they investigate, the higher up the corruption
goes to the Sea Lord's council itself. Can the heroes stop the plot to plunge
the city into madness before it is too late?<BR><BR><center><b>WHAT IS FREEPORT?</b></center><BR>
