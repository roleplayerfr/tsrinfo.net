<center>Tir Nan Og is the legendary Celtic Land of the Young, a world rather like
a legendary version of Northern Europe in a time before much of that continent
sank beneath the waves. The four Tribes of the Earth Goddess, on whom the
Sláine stories concentrate, are threatened on all sides, with the constant risk
of teh Fomorians sweeping down from the icy north, the Drune Lords encroaching
from the south and the ravages of the berserkers of Midgard in the east.<BR><BR>
Tir Nan Og is a land full of heroes, and full of great quests for those heroes
to do. This supplement aims to provide all you need to know to wander the
Land of the Young for decades, whether as a mercenary or cattle-rustler, thief
or adventurer, tribal emissary or war-band leader. All the major regions of
Tir Nan Og are covered, particularly places of interest and general geography.<BR><BR>
<b>Inside You Will Find:</center><BR>The Sessair:</b> The tribe that stands up.
These people consider themselves the strongest, the fiercest and most valiant of
the four tribes.<BR><BR><b>The Finians:</b> The tribe that endures. Both
proud and stubborn, Finians do not budge when their beliefs and customs are
attacked.<BR><BR><b>The Fir Domain:</b> The tribe of the growling shields. The
Fir Domain have a reputation for civility and sophistication. Their wisdom is
not only found in their counsel. The Fir Domain fight using that most unlikely
of Celtic weapons - a plan.<BR><BR><b>The Falians:</b> The tribe of the shadows.
Few things can unite the Sessair, Finians and Fir Domain in a unanimous
opinion, but the Tribe of the Shadows, or Falians, is definitely one of them.<BR><BR>
<b>Dinas Emrys and the Cambrian Mountains:</b> Dinas Emrys is known as the
Eternal Fortress, because it has always been atop Snowdon and always will be.<BR><BR>
<b>The Gaesatae:</b> Information on the gaesatae, the bands of Goddess-worshipping
elite mercenaries who wander Tir Nan Og.<BR><BR><b>Lands of the Drune Lords:</b>
Detailing the lands of the enemy, the sourlands and forbidding country of the
Drune Lords where they plot to being about Ragnarok.<BR><BR><b>The Borderlands:</b>
The lands that lie between the Tuatha de Danann and the Drunes are predominantly
occupied by two of the world's oldest civilisations, the Titans and the Fir Bolg.<BR><BR>
<b>Midgard:</b> Wedged between icy seas, towering mountains and the domains of
the earth goddess tribes sits Midgard, the land of the Norse tribes that are
the children of Voden.<BR><BR><b>Scenario Hooks:</b> Scenario hooks and ideas
to be used as is, or adapted to your own campaign to help bring the Land of the
Young to life.<BR><BR><b>Encounters in Tir Nan Og:</b> Random encounters
