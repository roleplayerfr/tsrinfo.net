The sea captain is a middle-aged man, with weathered features, thinning
gray hair, and a neatly trimmed gray beard. He peers at you with
penetrating green eyes, a huge tankard of ale clutched in one wrinkled
and calloused fist.<BR><BR>"My ship, the <i>Salt Dog</i>, is a
merchanter, a peaceful vessel of trade and commerce. I've been
sailing the southern seas for thirty years, and I've never had any
need of soldiers or mercenaries.<BR><BR>"But I'm thinkin' I may be in
need of 'em now. In two days, I sail for Storm Isle. There's a lot of
ocean between here and there, and it ain't rumored to be the safest
stretch o' water in the south.<BR><BR>"Word is, you can handle a sword
and it won't take you long to find your sea legs. If the winds stay
true, the voyage will take about ten days each way, so I'll be
needin' you for the better part of a month.<BR><BR>"I'll pay you each a
hundred and fifty gold, a third of that now, the rest when we get back.
Probably be the easiest gold you ever came by honestly. You'll also
have your own cabin on the <i>Salt Dog</i> and three square a day at
my table.<BR><BR>"The wind, the waves, a little adventure on the high
seas, and a purse full to spend in port when we return...<BR><BR>"What
say you... do we have a deal?"
