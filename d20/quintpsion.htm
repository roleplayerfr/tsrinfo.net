<center>The world of the psion is a strange and wondrous place. Where others see
magic or spirits, the psion is aware of the flows of thoughts and ideas. Able to
exert tremendous control over himself and others, the psion is a master of mental
energy and a creature who studies a much different type of science than the
members of other professions. By drawing upon his internal energies, the psion
frees himself from a dependence on the mystical flows of magic or the vagaries
of fickle gods on high. But this power has its limits as well and experienced
psions learn to control the ways in which they expend their energy to better
deal with the challenges they face.<BR><BR>Unlike the arcane or divine
spellcaster, the psion depends only on himself and the psionic energy produced
within his mind. This gives him a great deal of flexibility, allowing him to
call upon any power he knows and can fuel. Unlike even the flexible sorcerer,
the psion is not limited to a number or type of powers he can use each day - it
is all in how he manages the resources of his mind and the choices he makes at
the spur of the moment. Within the pages of this book, you will find new ways
to expand and enhance the power of psionics, providing the psion with new
options and augmentation for his existing abilities.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will
