<center>Familiars have long been a part of the arcane tradition and their
fabled past has been portrayed in many a yarn, old and new. They are depicted
in the tales as dedicated servants, faithful confidants, and in some cases as
unwavering soul mates, but no matter how they are described one thing is
certain: familiars are more than just simple companions to keep your feet warm
on a cold winter's night. They are in truth magical beings, bridges as is
were, between the mages they serve and the arcane power their masters wield.
Armed with this knowledge it is the aim of this tome to explore the world of
the familiar and to comprehend its unfamiliar nature.<BR><BR>Herein shall be
addressed an abundance of issues dealing with familiars and in order to give
the work a coherent structure the first section shall be dedicated to an
overview of the salient topics related to familiars. In this section we shall
discuss in short many of the fundamentals that shall be dealt with in more
detail later in this work. Also to be found in this section shall be a brief
discussion of the various types of familiars, from aberrations to magical
beasts to undead.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</b><BR><BR><table cellpadding=5>
