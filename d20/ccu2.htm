<center><b>U</b>pon the wind swept slopes of the Sickle lies the entrance to an
ancient dungeon. Here, in days past, a sect of wizards built their abode.
They bound their great dungeon by magical gates and within they gathered a
great store of wealth and knowledge. In those stone halls, safe from the world
around them, they sought to unravel the Secrets of Eternity.<BR><BR><b>B</b>ut
they were notsage from the world of the dark beyond. Legends tell of a day
when the mountain shook and the skies turned crimson and black.<BR><BR>
<b>W</b>hispers of magic, foul and terrible conjure images of a sorcery gone
foul and eldritch powers unleashed. But the truth of what befell the covenant
upon the Sickle is a mystery.<BR><BR><b>T</b>oday the Sickle stands quiet, dark
and lonely. Its stark peak a reminder to the bold and a lure to the foolish who
would dare seek their fortunes in its forsaken halls.</center>
