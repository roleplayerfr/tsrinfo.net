The sun hangs low over the gentle hills in the west as the road leads
you into a small, open city at the convergence of two rivers. As you
head into the center of town, you spy a market and a small collection
of buildings. Most of them look uninviting, with the exception of one
tavern, "The Boar's Head."<BR>You enter, and an enormous half-orc asks
you to leave any weapons with him. Seeing that he cannot be budged on
this matter, you comply.<BR>You step into the crowded main hall, and a
grinning dwarf in a freshly stained apron rolls over to you. "I'm Rugar,
and this is my place. What'll you have?"<BR>Soon after a round of
much-needed drinks, you're served a bland but satisfying dinner by the
gigantic half-orc you met at the door. "Name's Denaz," he grunts,
clearly doing his best to emulate Rugar's friendliness, even though he
just doesn't seem to have it in him.<BR>As you finish your meal, the
door to the tavern suddenly swings open, showing a city guardsman
standing in the frame. The room falls silent as he clears his throat.<BR>
"Good citizens! Beginning tonight, there will be a curfew enforced
within the limits of our fair town. Any citizen found on the streets
after sundown will be arrested. You are encouraged to make your way
home immediately."<BR>The dwarven bartender pokes his head up over the
bar in the back of the room. "What's up, Callam?" he asks, a look of
concern on his face. "You'd better have a good reason for sending my
customers home."<BR>The young man surveys the crowd intently for a
moment before turning his attention to the dwarf. "Some of you have
probably already heard. There's a killer on the loose in our town.
Seven dead so far this week, with the last two killed only last night."<BR>
The guard allows a horrified murmur to pass through the tavern before
he continues. "In a town of this size, there just aren't enough
people to properly patrol the streets. I need good people, strong and
able, to lend me a hand with this."<BR>With that, the guard's gaze
suddenly focuses on you.
