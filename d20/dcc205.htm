Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
The module you hold in your hands is a special edition produced
exclusively for Gen Con Indy 2005. It presents chapter one of an
adventure that chronicles the hilarious escapades of the hit film The
Gamers: Dorkness Rising. The King needs the heroes' help! The vile
necromancer Mort Kemnon has uncovered the <i>Mask of Death</i>, an
artifact of unspeakable evil. He plans to summon an army of undead to
attack the King while the divine powers of the realm are weak. Can the
heroes recover the <i>Mask of Death</i> and put a stop to Mort Kemnon's
evil plans once and for all?
If you enjoy this adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl Classics
series!
