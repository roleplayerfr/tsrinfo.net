<center><i>The King is dead...</i></center><BR>Hidden in frozen
wastelands and surrounded by untold treasures is the Kingdom of the
Seven-Day Sun, and home to wise King Jarrod. But times have changed.
At the peak of winter festivals, the head of Jarrod's guard finds his
lord dead upon his throne - <i>murdered</i>. As the castle and its
grounds close by both snow and suspicions, Crown Prince Hess and his
council, the Table of Lords, begin an investigation.<BR><BR>During his
coronation, Hess is also targeted and everyone is suspect. Even his
own kin, the Table of Lords, is not above suspicion, for each is a
potential heir to the throne. Fingers point and old rivalries return
as the truth is sought.<BR><BR>In the dead of winter, among murderous
alliances and old bonds of blood, regicide looms large. The greatest
terror the land has ever seen grows terrifyingly close to the throne,
and all that stands between the Kingdom of the Seven-Day Sun and its
fate is a band of foreign warriors untrusted by all.<BR><BR><center><i>
...long live the King!</i></center>
