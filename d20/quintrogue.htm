<center>The steely-eyed assassin clutching a serated dagger that drips
with fresh venom. The grey bearded old dwarf prospector with an eye
for traps and a nose for trouble. The halfling businessman, ready to
sell his own daughter for the right price and willing to slip his dagger
between your ribs if you turn your back on him. The high society
darling, belle of the ball, but at the stroke of midnight this lady
turns into the masked Rooftop Marauder. All these are examples of
rogues, the most flexible class available in the core d20 rules. <i>
The Quintessential Rogue</i> is a sourcebook that greatly expands the
gaming horizons of this class. Rogues have always relied on the wits
and resourcefulness, and now find rules for pursuing such roguish
behaviours as inventing a new poison, setting a trap to catch your
enemies, or founding a criminal empire that grows to span an entire
continent.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</center>Character Concepts<BR>
