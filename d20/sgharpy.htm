<center><b>Scourges of the Storm</b><BR><BR>Harpies are cruel and vicious
monsters that delight in the suffering of others. They also elevate selfishness
and narcissism to new heights in their constant drive to establish their
superiority over 'lesser' species, such as humans, dwarves and elves. Yet
many Games Masters probably consider harpies no better than animals, unthinking
brutes that can be used to challenge low to mid-level adventurers once creatures
such as orcs and hobgoblins cease to pose a threat to them. Unfortunately,
this fails to take into account the unique strengths and abilities of the harpy
which, when used properly, allow them to be used as opponents for even
high-level characters. <i>The Slayer's Guide to Harpies</i> is designed to
provide the Games Master with ideas on how to do just that.<BR><BR><b>Inside
You Will Find:</center><BR>Harpy Physiology:</b> The mere sight of these
winged monstrosities is enough to cause equal measures of terror and nausea
among those not experienced in detaling with them.<BR><BR><b>Harpy Sub-species:</b>
Detailing the Aiello, Celaeno, Nicothoe, Ocypete and the Podarge.<BR><BR><b>
Habitat:</b> Harpies are predators and, as such, prefer to make their homes in
areas where there is a ready source of food.<BR><BR><b>Harpy Society:</b> Harpies
who live together in the same area do so becaust they must, not because they
seek out the companionship of others or their kind.<BR><BR><b>Methods of
Warfare:</b> Harpies show an instinctual grasp of small unit tactics.<BR><BR><b>
Roleplaying Harpies:</b> A fully detailed chapter on running harpies in your
game.<BR><BR><b>Scenario Hooks and Ideas:</b> Some great ideas on how players
can meet these terrible creatures.<BR><BR><b>The Caves of Thunder:</b> A
complete lair which can be placed into any campaign with very little effort.<BR><BR>
