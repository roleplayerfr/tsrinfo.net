<center><b>All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good
men do nothing.<BR>-Edmund Burke-</b></center><BR>Mellisan: a bustling
trade center nestled within the broken ridges and deep valleys of the
Dragon's Claw Range. In the normally stoic city of steadfast people,
mounting disappearances and seemingly endless robberies have spawned
paranoia and mistrust. Rumors abound of lurking monsters and goblin
raids. Characters must race to solve the mysteries before they become
the targets of the town's suspicions.<BR><BR>Evil's Lesser Minions is a
1<sup><font size="-1">st</font></sup> level, d20 module for four to six
players. Players pursue multiple leads, finding the town beset by robberies,
disappearances, and back alley monsters. Seemingly unconnected leads
blend together and draw the characters down to a multiple level dungeon
occupied by the lesser minions of evil.
