the world spun istelf from darkness, built from a single
thought of the Allfathers, the Binding Words were written
and the wisdom of a thousand ages were cast into the fiery
memories of eternity. These words were carried to us by
the Forever Voices and in a thousand afterlifes we shall
relive its tale.<BR><BR>I cannot tell you how to live,
my brethren. All I offer is the wisdom of gods more
great than we. Live well, each day, their secrets are
yours. Cherish the gift of the heavens and divine
righteousness will never be robbed from you. Be right
and just and no foe can undo your glory and courage.</i></center><BR>
