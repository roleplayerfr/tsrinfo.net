power and wisdom were legendary. Now their cities are gone, their might buried
in forgotten ruins and hidden vaults. The Logheir built crystal towers that
reached towards the skies, proclaiming their challenge to the gods themselves.

year. The bards say their ancient kingdoms are no more... but now you wonder.<BR><BR>
You hear new stories. Long-dead things stir in a half-curied pyramid. A mighty
sword is discovered, attracting both treasure hunters and undead abominations.
A chance encounter on a solitary road leads to the sick and decadent court of

horrors beneath its pleasant face. You vow to discover the secrets of the
ancients, and survive to tell the tale...</i><BR><BR>Secrets of the Ancients
