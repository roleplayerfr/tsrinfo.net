<center><b>Demons and devils of legend walk the planes!</b></center><BR>
Awesome new role-playing experiences<BR><BR><ul><li>Mankind's history
provides us many legendary demons and devils of amazing power. Their
historical abilities have been translated into d20 powers and abilities
that will seriously challenge player characters.</ul><ul><li>Prestige
classes for the damned and nearly damned. Many of the demons and
devils have divine natures. These ultra powerful creatures naturally
give some of their powers and skills to those who slavishly worship
them.</ul><ul><li>These outsiders have brought with them some serious
magic items. Weapons, bracelets, and rings are just a few of the new
treasures you will find. Funny thing about these devices: when the
outsider is banished back to its original plane, all these nice magic
items just fall to the ground. Have you the courage to pick them up?</ul>
