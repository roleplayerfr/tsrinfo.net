<i>Something horrible has happened...</i><BR><BR>Deep in the elven
forests of Myereth, the ancient rowan trees spread white boughs above
a sacred site. Pillars of stone twist like some strange form of vine,
curling among the branches and reflecting light of a silvery moon. The
forest is silent and beautiful, protected since the dawn of time by a
powerful Unicorn.<BR><BR><i>Something that can never be repaired...</i><BR><BR>
Now, Myereth runs with blood, and the rowan trees have begun to wither
and die. In the center of the Rowan Grove, the bloodied bodies of the
last elven warriors of Myereth lie scattered and broken. Over them stands
a dark-robed sorceror lifting the bloody skull of a creature that may
once have been a horse - with a single, ivory horn.<BR><BR><i>The time
has come for innocence to die...</i><BR><BR>The elves of Myereth are
fading, their glamour lost, their forest rotting from the inside. A
blood ritual has cursed the sacred grove, and the Unicorn has been
destroyed. Only true heroes have the courage to save the elven nation.
Only those with legendary skill can hope to emerge victorious against
the Servants of the Blood Moon.<BR><BR><i>The time has come for a new
legend to be born.</i>
