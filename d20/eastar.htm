changeless. They have worshipped them, feared them, hidden from them and tried
to understand them. They are the one constant promise that, in a world of
constant chaos, there is something innately ordered and beautiful about the
universe.<BR><BR>Star magic is a school of magic that harnesses the hidden order
of the universe. In form, it is a science based on repetitive experiments and
