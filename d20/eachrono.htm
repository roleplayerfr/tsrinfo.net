<center>A forgotten art, a mystery to even the most powerful archmage,
chronomancy is a dark corner of magic, in which few dare to tread.
Wizards and sorcerers understand chronomancy as the simple manipulation
of time through arcane magic. These ignorant fools take the sacred name
of chronomancy in vain, having no idea of the forces they could unleash
with their meddling. Chronomancy is far more than the control of time;
in a world so vast, with so few who really understand, there can be no one
to warn fools from the path. Once you open the door on chronomancy and
allow its power to flow into your soul, thre can be no turning back.<BR><BR>
You hold in your hand the only true tome of chronomancy so far written.
Those skilled in the arcane arts can begin to muster the powers in
this book, learning the spells and incantation herein but be warned, the
true power of this tome comes only with an awakening so terrible that it
pushes the mind beyond the limits of sanity. The tenuous illusion spun
around you will be torn asunder and you will be left with nothing to
protect you from the storm raging invisibly about all creation.<BR><BR><b>
Inside you will find:</center><BR>Chronomancy - An overview:</b><BR>Awaken
to the hidden truths behind the manipulation of time.<BR><BR><b>Acolytes
of Time:</b><BR>Those who delve into the secrets of the <i>continuum</i>
are often shunned and feared, but for them, the reward is above any petty
risk.<BR><BR><b>Chronomancy Magic:</b><BR>New spells to harness the
power of time.<BR><BR><b>The Paradox of Power:</b><BR>The risks for
those who meddle with time are great, a mistake can cost your life, or
your very existence.<BR><BR><b>New Magic Items:</b><BR>From the
temporal chariot, to new crystal balls, a collection of new chronomatic
items, and rules on creating them.<BR><BR><b>The Denizens of the
Void-Between:</b><BR>New creatures that live beyond the boundaries of
time, or hunt those who meddle with it.<BR><BR><b>A Game Master's Guide

their own campaign.<BR><BR><center>FOR GAMES MASTERS AND PLAYERS ALIKE</center>
