<center>Loch-Durnan, a forested town shrouded in mist. It is a town
with closely guarded secrets, a town in trouble. Goblins have occupied
the caverns of "the pit," a hidden gold mine that makes the small town
prosperous. Injured in a raid on the goblins, the town's twin brother
mayors seek adventurers to do what they cannot. Simply put, drive the
goblins from the mine. Seems easy enough for a band of adventurers,
but not all is as it seems in the sleepy, mist-shrouded town. The mine
is not their only secret.<BR><BR>This massive adventure from Mystic
Eye Games will fit into any d20 fantasy setting. It is ideal for
4-6 characters from 2nd to 4th level. Immerse yourself in a plot of
intrigue, betrayal, and murder while trying to help a small town rid
its mine of evil goblins and more.<BR>Can your band of adventurers
help Loch-Durnan, or will they die in the dark caverns of the pit?<BR><BR>
