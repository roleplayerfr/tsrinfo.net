lord is found skewered by an iron lance, one of his retinue surviving
long enough to whisper, "Mortals" An entire human family is found
ruthlessly slaughtered in their sleep, traces of Faean magic still
lingering in the air.<BR>Ancient pacts between the Faean and the village
of Graymeer have ensured a lasting peace over the centuries. Now,
however, with ever increasing atrocities<BR>occuring to both sides,

Faean Realm, At the Edge of Dreams, to convince the Faean Court to
halt their attacks, before it is too late.<BR><BR><center>At the
Edge of Dreams is a d20 fantasy adventure for sixth to eighth level
