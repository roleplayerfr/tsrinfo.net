<center><b>They're more than just big, dumb, and strong.</b></center><BR>Of all
the monster types, giants are some of the most feared and interesting. They're
like the PCs in many ways: they're intelligent, they use weapons and armor, they
pursue many of the same goals of wealth, power, romance, and knowledge, and they
can take character class levels to specialize their skills and abilities.<BR><BR>
But they're bigger. Much bigger.<BR><BR>Following in the footsteps of
<a href="twisted.htm"><i>Twisted Lore</i></a>, this book gives
unprecedented options for a single type of monster. It contains 10 new giant
types, along with over a dozen new templates and prestige classes developed
specifically for these humanoid behemoths, so you can mix and match to create
the perfect foes for your gaming group.<BR><BR>Add in new feats, spells, and
equipment, and you will have giants ready to fill any role in your campaign.
Whether you want to add valorous allies or earth-shattering foes, <i>Giant Lore</i>
has just the 16-foot-tall force of nature you're looking for.
