cunning, and tactics are far more useful than a <i>+3 sword</i>. The perils
your characters face here can only be overcome with steady nerves and cold
steel!<BR><BR>Mysterious relics from an inhuman race have been found in the
forest and with them come great danger. From giant spiders to corrupted
cultists and dreaded alien races, strange menaces abound. If the innocent
are to be saved, if the treasure is to be won, if the monsters are to be
slain, the situation demands - IRON HEROES.<BR><BR></i>Song of the Blade</i>
