<center>Illusionism has always been seen as a weaker form of magic, a school to
be ridiculed rather than studied by most self-respecting mages. However, this
book shall reveal that illusionism is neithe to be scoffed at nor to be trifled
with.<BR><BR>At its heart, illusionism is the art of deception, be it benign
or malicious in nature. It alters another's perceptions and tricks their senses.
Those affected by illusions see, hear, smell, taste and feel things that are not
there.<BR><BR><b>Inside you will find:</center><BR>Illusionism - An Overview:</b>
A summary of the different areas of interest and concentration for illusionists.<BR><BR>
<b>Illusionist Paths:</b> Paths of concentration for specialist illusionists,
from orthodox to unorthodox to unaligned, each approach can have a potent effect
upon your character.<BR><BR><b>Orthodox Illusionism:</b> Orthodox illusionists
are interested in the artistic aspect of illusions and seek to create an
artful fiction through their figments, glamours, patterns and phantasms. Their
skills, feats and spells are detailed in depth.<BR><BR><b>Unorthodox Illusionism:</b>
Unorthodox illusionists deal more with the theory of what comprises an illusion
than the practical, even so their spells, feats and skills mean they are
seldom without a trick up their sleeves.<BR><BR><b>Unaligned Illusionists:</b>
Unaligned illusionists pick and choose what they wish to learn from either
school of theory and leave the rest. This has its own advantages and
disadvantages, along with spells and feats that allow them to add to their
powers.<BR><BR><b>Lords of Illusion:</b> To master the arts of illusionism is
to hold sway over perception and, in a way, reality itself. The five prestige
classes presented here allow players to master the smoke and mirror of
illusionism.<BR><BR><b>Rose Coloured Glasses:</b> A collection of magic items,
particularly suited to being used by illusionists.<BR><BR><center>FOR GAMES
MASTERS AND PLAYERS ALIKE</center>
