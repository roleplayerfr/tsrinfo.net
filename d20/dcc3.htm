Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>In this all-new adventure,
the characters come across an ancient wizard's tower. The nearby keep has
been reduced to rubble over the ages, but the tower is in perfect condition.
It is surrounded by an impenetrable force field that cannot be breached -
not even by the ghost of the long-dead wizard, who has been trapped
within for centuries. Surely there must be great treasure within this
magical abode. But how to get in?<BR><BR>If you enjoy this adventure,
look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl Classics series!
