Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
For centuries, the Great Swamp has hidden hints of an ancient culture of
barbarian kings. While passing through this miserable bog, the heroes
encounter Stygoth the Damned, a half-dead black dragon driven mad by a
mysterious disease. Delving further, the heroes discover that the disease
is tied to the very swamp itself. A great corruption once infested this
place, destroying the savage barbarian kings and leaving only mighty
statues as their legacy. Now this corruption has returned, and a terrible
Witch Queen is mining the corrupted swamp-earth to produce evil, blighted
artifacts. In order to stop the spread of these evil weapons, the heroes
must enter the ancient caves of the savage kings, put to rest the
corrupt legacy of their downfall, end the disease that scars the land,
and then face off against the Witch Queen herself.

Classics series!
