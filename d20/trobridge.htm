<b>Trobridge Inn</b> is an exciting adventure module that brings players
to a frontier outpost and involves them in intrigue and terror.
Diplomacy and strength are essential skills for survival.<BR><BR>The site
is a fortified inn and key layover for caravans on the main trail
between eastern and western Hârn. The inn lies on the western edge of
<i>Chelmarch</i>, a vast territory claimed by the Kingdom of Kaldor,
but controlled by the warlike Chelni barbarians. The Thardic Senate
also covets Trobridge.<BR><BR>Trobridge is controlled by two rival
factions. Terlin Wesindan holds the inn and employs mercenaries to
oppose Kurson Ondailis, a warlord who exacts tribute from locals and
caravans.<BR><BR>Into this volatile situation arrive two official
embassies, a herald from Kaldor and a seductive priestess from Tharda.
They have come to see if Kurson Ondailis is strong enough to control
Trobridge. Complicating matters, a mad priest appears with summoned
<i>Vlasta</i>, and warring barbarian tribes may destroy Trobridge.<BR><BR><b>
