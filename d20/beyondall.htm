As the winter winds stir, a group of fire giants march home, having
been defeated by the human soldiers of the nearby frontier keep. Though
they did not take the castle, there is no feeling of defeat for this
war band; taking the castle was not their objective.<BR>As the sun rises
the following day, soldiers from the keep appear, following the tracks
of their rebuked enemies. Instead of attacking the giants, the
soldiers surrender, merging their numbers with those they bravely fought
against only a night before.<BR><BR>What force could motivate the fire
giants to war, only weeks before the onset of winter? What power could
cause hundreds of loyal soldiers to betray their fellows and join with
their former enemies? What need could compel the reclusive yuan-ti to
set forth from their lairs, in search of human aid? Is there some
insidious plot at work here, or are these events simply <i>beyond all
reason?</i><BR><BR><center><b>An epic fantasy adventure for 13th-level
characters.</b></center><BR><b><i>Beyond All Reason</i></b> presents an
action-packed adventure, full of mysterious situations, fearsome foes,
and exotic environments. At the core of the scenario is a mind-boggling
enigma forcing enemies to become allies and allies to become enemies.
Featuring a variety of encounters that will test the skill of the most
heroic adventurer, <i>Beyond All Reason</i> is an adventure of giant
proportions!
