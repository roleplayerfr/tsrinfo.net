<center><b>The Most Dangerous Foe</b><BR><BR>Understand this. The Games
master is your enemy. He may come under different names - Games Master,
judge, referee... friend - but he is always your enemy. It's a different
game he's playing, with different rules and different objectives.<BR><BR>
His game is about control and dominance. He might dispute this, may use
words such as 'storytelling', but ask yourself this: Whose story is it he
wants to tell?<BR><BR>His.<BR><BR>Now contrary to what certain 1980s
animated series might have had you believe, Games Masters are not in the
habit of descending from the heavens to walk on earth, for the very good
reason that within five minutes they'd find themselves with a knife to
their throat, and a voice whispering in their ear: 'Tell the dragon to
back away slowly...' (Or perhaps end up nailed to a tree, depending on the
genre).<BR><BR>But don't get despondent, for Games Masters can be
defeated.<BR><BR>And I'm going to tell you how.<BR><RB><b>Recommended for<BR>
Mature Readers only</b><BR><BR>FOR GAMES MASTERS AND PLAYER ALIKE</center>
