Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
An apocalyptic cult of demon worshipers has been kidnapping farmers from
the local hamlets and offering them up as sacrifices for their
blasphemous idols. The heroes are called in for what appears to be a
simple mission: hunt down the demon worshipers, beard them in their lair,
and demolish their dark abbey, down to the last stone. But this cult is
under the direct control of a demon prince with much bigger ambitions.
The heroes' exploration of the dark abbey soon leads them into a portal
to another plane, where they discover the demon prince's hellish scheme -
and learn they have only hours to save their world from being destroyed!
Can they defeat the demon prince in his own citadel?
<BR><BR>If you enjoy this adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl
Classics series!
