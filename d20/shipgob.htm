<center><b>Carnage of the High Seas</b><BR><BR>Feared across the ocean,
a ship crewed by the goblinoid races is able to overcome any merchantman
and many warships with a determined attack. These races live for war
and battle, and their vessels are designed to fulfil this specific need
on the high seas. Any adventurer taking to the sea should be very much
aware of these ships, for goblinoid pirate and war fleets are a common
feature of many oceans and if one is expecting to survive any such
encounter, then a basic knowledge of the way these ships function is
essential.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:<BR><BR>Goblinoids at Sea:</b>
Never before covered lore showing just how the goblinoids wage war at
sea. From the ramshackle fleets of the goblins, through the merciless
efficiency of the hobgoblin pirates, their tactics, aims and capabilities
are examined in exquisite detail. The massive orc war fleets are also
depicted, demonstrating just what this numerous and ambitious race can
achieve given only isolation and a charismatic warlord.<BR><BR><b>Crews:</b>
Detailed information on the vile crews to be found serving on board the
ships of the goblinoids. Unscrupulous adventurers may even try hiring
these unreliable but cheap sailors<BR><BR><b>Weaponry:</b> New shipboard
weapons employed by the goblinoid races, from the insidious Diseased
Catapult Shot to the renowned and devastating Orc Hammerfist.<BR><BR><b>
Ships of the Goblinoids:</b> A multitude of new ships, covering a huge
range of goblinoid vessels. From the barely floating Goblin War Raft,
through the deadly Hobgoblin Swift Sea Cutter and Predator Fast Frigate,
goblinoids have the potential to dominate any ocean. Also included are
the massive warships of the orcs, such as the lethal Warhammer Battle
Galley and the massive, awe-inspiring Great Axe Battleship. A total
of 16 new ships are shown, complete with deckplans, alongside 'templates'
allowing you to represent any vessel in the possession of the goblinoids.<BR><BR>
