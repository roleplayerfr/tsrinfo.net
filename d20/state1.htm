<center>These pages display the portrait of a young world experiencing the
first blush of true, continent-wide politics. Since the Gods War there
have been many conflicts, but these have always been isolated, between
two countries, never involving the others. For the first time in the
history of the world, the six major nations of Diomin (first detailed
in the <a href="diomin.htm">Diomin Worldbook</a>) are
beginning to rub elbows with more than just their immediate neighbors.
The first trade treaties are being drafted, ambassadors are being sent,
spies are finding greater employment. And the slightest wrong move
could set the whole of the world on fire.<BR><BR>Read on. Discover
what makes the nations unique. Learn how they feel about the others...
and how the others react to them. Take on the roles of the Gadianti
Robber and the Hearthom Trader, and then look at the world with new
eyes. Most of all, watch your back, for not everyone is what they
appear to be.</center>
