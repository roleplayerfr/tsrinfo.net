character sheet is the cornerstone of your PC. As campaigns
go on, your sheet can get overloaded with abilities, magic
items, spells, and notes. It's way more than one measly
sheet can hold, but that's all the game gives you to work
with.<BR><BR>Not any more.<BR><BR>The Origins Award winning d20 System
Character Record Folio is a specially designed cure for the record
sheet blues. It's built to track your character for a
whole campaign and then some.<BR>Inside its 16 beautifully
designed pages you'll find:</center><ul><li>Mini character sheets
for the paladin's warhorse, wizard's familiar, and druid's
animal companion.<li>A special page for cohorts and followers.<li>
A character advancement tracker that makes dealing with level
loss a breeze.<li>A spellcaster's grimoire and a page for psionic
powers.<li>A contact record for important NPCs.<li>An adventure
log where you can record the history of your campaign.<li>
Handy reference tables.<li>Plus all the essentials you'd
expect from a great character record sheet.</ul><center><b>
Doesn't your character deserve the very best?</b></center>
