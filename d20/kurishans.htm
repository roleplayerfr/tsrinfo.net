As you take a well-deserved break in a city that seems friendly enough,
you quickly notice an unusual amount of activity around the marketplace,
as well as the unresonable cost for meals at every inn. You soon
discover that many food items have become scarce in the city, causing
prices for those goods to soar and creating a mild panic among the
population.<BR>Having heard of your party of bold adventurers, Marrick,
a leader among the local merchants, approaches you on behalf of his
fellows.<BR>"Over the past few years," Marrick explains, "our fair city
has become dependent upon a village named Darbin, about five day's
travel to the west. The village's farms yield a great harvest each
year, and they have become a major supplier of our city's fruits and
vegetables."<BR>"The problem is this: No deliveries have been made by
the farmers of Darbin in over two months. Twice messengers have been
sent to Darbin, but neither has returned. Their seasonal harvest
should be complete by now, and yet not one wagon has appeared. If they
don't send their goods soon, we will have to cast our nets farther
abroad and pay even higher sums to meet the demands of our citizens."<BR>
"We ask that you do to Darbin and speak with Brock Gnath, the head of the
village's farmers, and find out what needs to be done to rectify this
situation. A few of us have collected what we hope is a reasonable sum
in payment for your services.<BR>"Please accept our offer. We need your
help."
