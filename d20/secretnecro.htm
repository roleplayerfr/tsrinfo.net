<center><b>- Death Never Sleeps! -</b></center><BR>Necromancy. What is
it about this word, above so many others, that its merest whisper, a
voice on the wind, can so completely inspire revulsion in even the
strongest of men? Given the hatred it inspires, what sort of person
chooses this dark path? Who among us chooses to be an outcast, a
pariah, even a target of the Inquisition? With its dabblings in blood
and corrupted flesh, graveyards and abattoirs, unclean spirits and
immortal scoundrels, what is the appeal of this dark art?<BR><BR><i>
Secret College of Necromancy</i>, second in Green Ronin's <i>Arcana</i>
series, answers all these questions and more. The essential sourcebook
on necromancy, this dark tome is packed with information for Game
Masters and players alike, including:<BR><BR><ul><li>Two new core
classes: the necromancer and the death knight.<li>74 new necromancy
spells, including spells of two new types: mortal curses and dark
pacts.<li>New feats and magic items, plus full descriptions of 8 infamous
tomes.<li>8 new monsters, including the death angel, the flayed man,
and the blood golem.<li>The Secret College, a complete, city-based
necromantic organization.<li>Detailed locations like the Winter Manor
and the Charnel House.<li>Full stat blocks for key members of the
Secret College.</ul>Written by <i>2nd edition AD&D</i> architect David
"Zeb" Cook and former <i>Dragon Magazine</i> editor Wolfgang Baur,
<i>Secret College of Necromancy</i> is the definitive treatment of the
dark art of death!
