<center>The frothing berserker gnaws upon with shield in expectation of a bloody
battle and howls his rage. The scarred veteran raider stands upon the prow of
his longship, eager to lead his men to spoils that await the warrior in the homes
and hearths of soft city dwellers. The painted savage blends into the thick
jungles, blowgun ready for the kill, tasting the air for his prey. The
Amazon warrior, the arctic hunter, the swamp warrior, the town drunk, on and on
goes the list of those who would be barbarians. <i>The Quintessential Barbarian</i>
greatly expands the options for the barbarian class, elevating the barbarian
from a killing machine to a fully realised character that functions as a
viable alternative to the precise fighter, vainglorious paladin and the
foe-slaughtering double-weapon wielding ranger.<BR><BR>The barbarian is a figure
of absolute violence, his abilities largely centered on boosting his raw
strength and endurance. When he enters a rage, he is harder to manipulate and
is, most certainly, a figure that inspires fear in his enemies. The barbarian
is the one who throws caution to the wind, flings himself through doorways,
bathes in the blood of his foes and dares any to stand against him.<BR><BR><b>
