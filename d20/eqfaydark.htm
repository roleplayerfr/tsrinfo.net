<center><b>The Forest is Lovely, Dark and Deep</b></center><BR>...and the
orcs of Crushbone have promises to keep. Namely, doing more than just
carving out a home for themselves in a forest swarming with elves, faeries,
giant wasps, and spiders - and other, <i>darker</i> things as well.<BR>
Emperor Crushbone is intent on claiming the whole of Faydark. Forget the
two elven cities, Kelethin of the wood elves and Felwithe of the High
Elves. Pay no heed to the rangers and the druids who protect these woods,
as well as the mysterious arboreans. These things may be of little concern,
for it is rumored that the orcs have forged an alliance. Is it with the
clandestine cult known as the Unseen, hidden within the Hills of Shade?
With the dark elf vampire lord Mayong Mistmoore himself? Some elves are
concerned enough that they seek visions of the future in the waters of
Elizerain Lake... but the images there are more troubling still.<BR><BR><center><b>

The latest in the "Realms of Norrath" series, <i>Forests of Faydark</i>
details the central regions of the Faydwer continent, including Greater
and Lesser Faydark, the Hills of Shade, and Elizerain Lake, as well as two
elven cities and the orc stronghold of Crushbone. This vast amount of
source material allows for innumberable stories and adventures, but one
ready-to-run adventure is also included: "The Barrow of Aataltaal."</center>
