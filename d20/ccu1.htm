<center><b>Alea Iacta Est<BR><BR>The Die is Cast!</b><BR><BR>A dreadful
fear and teror-born nightmares linger in the shados of the Halfling's Halls.<BR><BR>
Brambletoe Hall had ever been deep, warm and filled with mirth. Here, the
good Mayor Willic Brambletoe has long presided over a board of warm
mutton, fresh apples, berries, peaches and the like, as well as wondrous
breads, warm butter and cool drink. Mayor Willic welcomes all, inviting
many various and sundry folk to sit and eat with him, or to gather
about his great hall and make merry, pass the time and exchange news of
distant happenings in exotic lands.<BR><BR>But something has changed in
that noble Halfling's Halls and a Shadow of Evil has taken up abode there.
Not many days past, in those deep hours before the dawn, the sounds of
merriment changed to cries of despair. A haunting came to the Goodman's
home and left an air filled with the noise of terror and a foul odor of
unrepentant evil.<BR><BR>Abandoned now, a shadow has hung over the hall
ever since. Foul play or murder, none know. But the Shadow of Fear has
spread, weirdlings haunt the late hours of the night, stalking the
environs of Newbriar. And the locals now say Newbriar has come at last to
know the shallow welcome of the other world.<BR><BR>In fear, the folk of
Newbriar have called for aid, sending riders forth to find courageous
heroes willing to rid the town and its suffragans of the terror of the<BR>
Shadows of the Halfling Hall.</center>
