Gary Gygax's <b>Necropolis</b> is a vast campaign scenario that sweeps
the characters into an epic adventure across the magical desert kingdom
of Khemit. From a hidden evil in a desert village, to the secrets of
ancient tombs, <b>Necropolis</b> takes the characters on a dangerous
mission to thwart the plans of an undying archpriest-wizard who would
be a god! <b>Necropolis</b> is also a campaign sourcebook, detailing
the lands of Khemit, new classes and prestige classes, new spells and
more than 60 monsters unique to the desert lands. This book also details
over 50 new gods and new cleric domains, allowing DMs to run extended
campaigns in the desert kingdom.<BR><BR><center><b><i>Players beweare!
