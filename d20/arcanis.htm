It's the end of the world.<BR>In the north, the nation of Canceri begins
to buckle from the weight of the theocracy's oppressive rule - most
pray for death, and the rest, for deliverance.<BR>Enemies gather round
the proud nation of Milandir, each one eager to pull down its bright

Empire sleeps under an indifferent ruler, while its greatest general
bides his time, waiting to seize the throne for his own noble house.

the continent of Onara, strife threatens to tear the nations of man
apart.<BR>It's like the end of the old world...<BR>And the beginning of
a new.<BR>Welcome to Arcanis, the World of Shattered Empires<BR><BR><b>
