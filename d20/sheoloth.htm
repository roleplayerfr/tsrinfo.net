<center>Crouched within a vast cavern complex, the city of Sheoloth is a skeleton
of stone wrapped in tortured flesh and clad in robes of woven silk. From its
beginnings as a captured fortress, Sheoloth has slowly expanded over the decades.
Expansion of the city eats away at the stone around it, leaving behind thick
cores of marble and basalt to support the ceiling of the city. Glittering
corpselights wander the streets, providing illumination to both the estates
of the nobility and the meanest hovel of the most poverty-striken foreigners.
It is a place of strange beauty and stark power, at once serene and filled
with chaotic violence, Sheoloth is a true home to the drow.<BR><BR>This mighty
tome details a complete subterranean city, populated by the most vicious and
twisted race ever depicted in fantasy - the Drow! Adaptable to any existing
campaign, Sheoloth may be used as the centrepiece to many scenarios, pitting
the players against the most evil elves to rule the Underdeep, or as the scene
of destructive politicking between rival drow nobles.<BR><BR>FOR GAMES MASTERS
AND PLAYERS ALIKE</center>
