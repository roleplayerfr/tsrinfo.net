<center><b>Druid's Revenge!</b></center><BR>Can your PCs make it through
the forest on the way to their final destination? Will they be ensnared
in the mystery of the dreaded ghoul wolves, or become entangled in a
battle between druids and insects that is slowly destroying a small logging
village? Are your PCs strong enough to enter the Canyons of Arcuri? Perhaps,
they are even bold enough to enter the private, forested demiplane of the
mad druid Niavark. This book contains forest-based adventures for several
levels of play that are generic enough for any setting.<BR><BR><center><b>
Read the Leaves</b></center><BR>Glades of Death contains new spells, new
feats, and a new look at skills and how to use them in the wilderness.
Tables and suggestions for the rapid creation of new fantasy forests are
also provided along with new monsters to surprise the PCs. The four new
forest-based adventures within provide oppurtunities to use the new feats
and spells while challenging PCs, and players, to regard a trip through the
forest with fear, rather than simply a step toward a new dungeon, castle,
or city.<BR><BR><center><i>Requires the use of the Dungeons & Dragons
