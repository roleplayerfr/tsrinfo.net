Up until two days ago, folks in the town where you've been staying only
knew the nearby village of Tonwell for its magnificent cathedral. Two
hundred years in the making, the cathedral is a monument to how much
work and dedication a simple farming community can put into its house of
worship.<BR><BR>But now, Tonwell has been overrun by savage barbarians.
Burning and pillaging, they struck without warning or provocation,
showing no mercy but reveling in atrocity. Now there are refugees from
Tonwell here on the streets, terrified and desperate. They say the
barbarians raiding the village enslaved all they could, and slaughtered
those who couldn't.<BR><BR>One of those refugees, a priest named Carawyn,
has discretely spread the word that he has a secret mission for those
who are brave enough to venture into Tonwell. His mission has your
interest because, as all adventurers know, "secret" usually also means
"lucrative."
