Included along with the DM's screen are <b>The Shrine of Madness</b> and
<b>Kadum's Horn</b>, adventures for beginning to mid-level characters
that introduce you to the unique dangers of the Scarred Lands campaign
world. You also get fully detailed racial ability rules and racial
descriptions for generating characters in the Scarred Lands or for use
as optional rules for your own campaign world.</td></tr><tr><td><BR></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFDDAA">
