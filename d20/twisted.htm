Continuing the <i>"Lore"</i> line, <i>Twisted Lore</i> contains more than thirty
new aberrations, oozes, and shapechangers, as well as a pair of templates that
make new foes out of old friends. Your players can flee before the onslaught of
the vile, or bond themselves to a mana symbiote. They can ride into battle on
the battle of the versatile doppel steed or face werecreatures of legend with
powers they'll never expect.<BR><BR>The horrors in this bestiary were created
to fill specific roles in your campaign. Whether you need a particularly
challenging encounter to spring on your players or just want to add a touch of
exotic flair to your world, <i>Twisted Lore</i> has just the abomination you're
looking for.
