<a href="bluerose.htm"><i>Blue Rose</i></a>, the Roleplaying Game
of Romantic Fantasy, introduced the fantastic Kingdom of Aldis and allowed
players to explore the world of Aldea for the first time. Now, that world is
yours. In <i>World of Aldea</i>, Aldis and its neighboring nations are described
in detail, giving you all new information and settings for your <i>Blue Rose</i>
adventures. In its pages you will find the lands of:<BR><BR><ul><li><i>Aldis</i>,
the legendary Kingdom of the Blue Rose, heart of the rebellion against the
Sorcerer Kings, inheritor of the Old Kingdom. Experience its wonders from the
capitol city and the central valleys to the far-flung wilds of the Pavin Weald,
the Ice-Binder Mountains, and the Veran Marsh.</ul><ul><li><i>Jarzon</i>,
Theocracy of the Purist Church, a land surrounded by enemies on all sides,
wounded by wars against the Sorcerer Kings, and beset by dangers from corrupt
and savage lands.</ul><ul><li><i>Rezea</i>, the wild plains where the Rezean
clans ride and keep their herds roaming free. Travel across the sea of grass to
to the ancestral wintering grounds. Explore mysterious stone circles and
witness the rites of the witches of the horse clans.</ul><ul><li><i>Kern</i>,
the deadly land of the Lich King, last of the Sorcerer Kings. From the Ebon
Tower and the foul city of Sarn to the crystal mines where slaves toil under
the whips of their inhuman overseers, it is a land crying out for liberation.
Will you be the heroes to aid its people?</ul><ul><li><i>Lar'tya</i>, an island
matriarchy and a trading partner of Aldis, in spite of the differences between
their two cultures. Explore the exotic shoals of the sea-folk and the salons
of the ruling caste of the island nation.</ul><i>World of Aldea</i> provides
more details on the Roamers, wanderers cast adrift in the world when their
land fell to corruption and the Shadow. Learn the truth of their terrible fate
and find out why their homeland is now an accursed place where only the brave
and the foolhardy go.<BR><BR>All this and plenty of room for adventure! <i>
World of Aldea</i> includes the full-length adventure <i>Martyr's Blood</i>
along with short adventure outlines and adventure seeds for each nation. A
world of adventure and danger is yours to explore!
