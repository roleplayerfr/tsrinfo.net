<center><b>Journey to the Center of the Earth</b></center><BR>What has lured
the gnomes of Ak'Anon from their home in the Steamfont Mountains, across
Faydwer and the vast Ocean of Tears, to create an outpost in possibly the
most unforgiving and dangerous environment in all of Norrath?<BR>The
region of caverns and lava-filled tunnels known as Solusek's Eye is in the
heart of the Lavastorm Mountains near its namesake, a gigantic caldera of
lava whence Solusek Ro himself is said to sometimes gaze upon the world.
It's here that the gnomes and their clockwork minions defend a small
portion of the caves from kobolds and goblins, as well as from seemingly
unnatural predators like stone spiders and sonic bats. Did the gnomes
come for the enormous mineral and gem deposits, or is the Solusek Mining
Company just a cover for a more ambitious undertaking?<BR>And the mystery
deepens: Why, unbeknowst to the gnomes, does the mighty red dragon Lord
Nagafen demand that his servants - fire giants, goblins, and kobolds
alike - stay their hands from exterminating the tinkering intruders?<BR><BR>
</center><b>100% compatible with 3.5 edition fantasy role-playing rules</b></center><BR>
This sourcebook details the history and present circumstances of the
complicated environment in and around Solusek's Eye, including complete
settlements of goblins, kobolds, and gnomes, as well as the Citadel of the
Krombral, a city teeming with fire giants who avoided the ancient curse of
idiocy that affected many of the giant race. In addition, for the first
time anywhere, this sourcebook offers a true sneak-peek at some of the new
material that will appear online in EverQuest II.<BR>For instance, what
part do the gnomes <i>really</i> play in the politics of Solusek's Eye?
