The ancestral swords of a powerful lord have been stolen! In the dark
of night, on the eve of battle, a shadowy figure crept into Lord
Kunemura's chamber and made off with the most potent symbols of his
power and lineage. Worse, Lord Kunemura has declared war on his old
enemy, Lord Shotokami. The imminent battle will be decisive, and the
future of Lord Kunemura's lands and family hand in the balance.<BR><BR>
The loss of the swords would be a terrible blow to morale if Lord
Kunemura's troops hear of the theft. The lord's chamberlain, Tsuyokaze,
begs you to recover the swords at any price. According to Tsuyokaze,
the chief suspect is the Kunemura's chief historian, Hanashi, who was
suspiciously absent on the morning after the theft.<BR><BR>Three servants
were killed during the theft, and others whisper of seeing a ninja.<BR><BR>
Find the thief and the stolen swords before it is too late!
