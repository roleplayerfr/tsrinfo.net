<center>FOR PUBLIC POSTING:</center>Last week, several laborers who
were working to clean up the damage to our sewer caused by the recent
earthquake have been found brutally murdered. Until further notice,
citizens should stay clear of any sewer gratings, openings, or tunnels
for their own safety. Do not allow children to play unattended in
areas where such openings are known to exist.<BR>The governor is
assembling a group of interested persons to investigate these murders.
Each member of the investigation team will receive 500 gp up front,
with an additional 2,000 gp to follow upon a thorough and satisfactory
completion of the investigation, provided evidence that the matter has
been dealt with is presented to the governor. If you desire to join
this investigation, please apply at City Hall.
