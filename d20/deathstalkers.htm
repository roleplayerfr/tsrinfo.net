The world is a broken and ruined place. The great kings of men have
fallen and their kingdoms wiped from the face of the planet. The races of
the world are divided and leaderless; the heroes of yore are but a
whispered memory. The Juggernauts - the great foes and destroyers of kings -
once thought gone from these lands, have arisen once again. Here, in the
lands of Arkastapha, where they once sought to destroy kingdoms, they now
seek to obliterate the last races of the world.<BR>But another threat
rises against man as well. The Demons, once content in the frozen arctic
wastes, have become restless and weary of man. Too long have they
suffered the frigid north, and now they seek to rise up and take the
world for their own. Fearsome and terrible fiends are they, and all who
gaze upon them tremble and despair.<BR>And one by one, as war tears apart
the cities of Man, the races break their allegiances of old and leave
their ancient comrades to whatever end. The thunderous footfalls of the
Juggernauts now echo the final tidings of doom, and the cities burned by
the Demons are but beacons of death and failure.<BR>But ever is there
hope. In time there may arise new heroes, like those of legend, who
would dare tread the roads now cloaked in shadow. Some may seek
treasures long forgotten; others may seek out fame. Still others may
reach for a higher goal and seek a means to unite the races once again or
raise an army mighty enough to face the Juggernauts. All this here, in
the lands of Arkastrapha, where only the brave dare tread.<BR><BR><b>A
