<center>Humanity's myths are dreams of dragons. No other creature is
quite so present, so dominant, in our stories. Almost every culture has
its own tales of the serpents. Our fantasy reflects this, and dragons have
been one of the defining elements of the fantasy genre for decades, and
their pedigree in adventure gaming is obvious. There is a good reason for
this pre-eminence - no other creature has the power or the terrifying
majesty of the dragons, no other creature has the curious alchemy of
horror and glory that makes dragons so wonderful. On leathern wings,
they soar across the skies of our imagined worlds. Their fire threatens
the world, but also illuminates it.<BR><BR><i>The Desolation of the Dragon</i>
describes the region around a lair, and explores the effects dragons have
on their environment. <i>Watchers on the Mountain</i> provides a system
for tracking the progress of an adventuring party and the responses of the
dragon and its servants. <i>Servants of the Dragon</i> has details on the
various kinds of warriors and pawns used by dragons to defend their lairs
and affect the mortal world.<BR><BR><i>Dragon Lairs</i> has all the
detail needed to design a dragon's lair, from a dank cave filled with
rotting remains of previou adventurers to an ancient ruined city despoiled
by the beast. When a party finally encounters the dragon, <i>Flattery and
Riddles</i> lets them have a few last moments before the dragon employs its
<i>Tactics and Warfare</i> to wipe them out.<BR><BR>If by some miracle the
party survive, they can delve into the fabled <i>Hoards</i> of the dragons,
or even into the carcass of their foe with reference to <i>Anatomy of the
Dragon</i>.<BR><BR><i>Age Advancement</i> presents a variant method for
creating dragons especially skilled in warfare, or magic, or some other
field of expertise. A selection of new <i>Feats</i> (with especially
emphasis on the feared breath weapon) follows. The rules in those two
chapters are then used as the basis of a system of <i>Dragon Design</i>.<BR><BR>
The nightmarish fruits of that system are presented in <i>New Dragons</i>,
ranging from the parasitical Sin Dragons to the noble Heraldic Dragon and
chaotic Planar Dragons.<BR><BR><i>Dragon Magic</i> has new spells and items
for dragons (and their enemies). <i>Lifecycle</i> and <i>Heritage of
Dragons</i> delves into the physiology and history of the draconic species.
<i>Hatching and Raising Dragons</i> examines the egg. <i>Campaigning</i>
contains advice on using dragons in a game, as symbols, enemies, allies,
mounts or even characters. Finally, <i>a Mortal Miscellany</i> deals with
the response of the lesser races to the dragons.<BR><BR>FOR GAMES MASTERS
