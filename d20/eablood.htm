<center>The ancient practice of blood magic has been outlawed in many
civilised societies, for though it allows access to staggering levels of
magical power the price can be very high. Savage tribes often respect
blood magic, though even they tend to fear and avoid it where possible -
its power is the stuff of legend, to be invoked only by those who expect
to achieve great things or die in the attempt. A few warriors of the old
school will swear blood brotherhood or other blood oaths but learning
much more than that is generally the province only of primitive sorcerers
or the most vile and despicable wizards. Those who go into blood magic
with good intentions often find themselves seduced by its savage power,
and soon want more - at whatever cost, up to and including dozens of
innocent lives.<BR><BR>The power inherent in sentient blood has been
recognised by many of the great philosophers and sages throughout history,
both religious and secular. Whether spilling his own blood to fuel his
spells, creating a ritual to bond two comrades in blood brotherhood, or
sacrificing enemies for magical power, the practitioner of blood magic
is drawing upon that ancient, primal force, and must take great care that
he can control it, and not vice versa.<BR><BR><center><b>Inside You
