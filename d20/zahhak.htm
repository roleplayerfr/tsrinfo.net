<center>There is no torture worse than one people learn to live with
and even embrace as part of life. From one of the Abyss' infinite
layers, such a dark and terrible deity works his way into the hearts of
mortals. There are no temples to his name, his priesthood is not
prosecuted, and there have been no holy quests against his work. He
is the ruler of Zahhak and is known to the rank and file of his cult
only as Apathy.<BR><BR>The 28th layer of the Abyss stand forgotten among
the greater and more active evils that make their name infamous across
the Material Plane. Its ruler does not care for recognition as long
as he collects his due: the dreams and hopes of everything that lives,
crushed under his smothering grip. The bitter words of ex-lovers, the
exhaustion that remains after anger has left, the boredom that stains
the simplest joys, the disillusionment of goals unattained, and the
inertia of life without direction are the evils that Apathy spreads
and that coalesce in Zahhak, with its unending landscape of ashen
dunes. Ash is all that is left behind after a fire has burned, as so
does Zahhak remain where hope and faith die. The dark lord of the
Ashen Waste is not a terrible deity that threatens the world with
destruction nor plans campaigns of conquest spanning worlds. He is a
thousand times more dangerous because he is allowed to exert his
influence unpunished. He is content to let the soulwinds of his realm
erode all that is good and pure.<BR><BR>FOR GAMES MASTERS AND PLAYERS
