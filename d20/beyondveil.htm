<center><b>An Undying Love</b></center><BR>The northern reaches of the
Derideth Swamp were once plagued by a rampaging dragon, named Storamere.
He took a mad glee in attacking human villages, wiping out orc camps,
driving off the lizardfolk, and decimating farmland. He met his untimely
end, though, in an ambush devised by the monks of the Order of St.
Chasle. Storamere died with a curse upon his draconic tongue: "You could
not have defeated me in my lair," he told his slayers. "I am forever
invincible in my lair."<BR><BR>Now Storamere is back, with a horde of
his misshapen half-dragon offspring, to have his vengeance. All that
remains of the once-heroic monks are two old men driven mad by their
last encounter with the black dragon, so it falls to a band of
adventurers to again defeat the mighty dragon - this time in his palace,
where the boastful Storamere claims he is at his strongest.<BR><BR><i>
Beyond the Veil</i> is a D20 System adventure designed for characters
of 9th level and up. It includes:<BR><BR>Stats for the deviant Storamere's
half-dragon progeny, including a monstrous stone giant, umber hulk,
gaint constrictor, manticore, carrion crawlers, and dark elves, all
with dragon parentage.<BR><BR>New D20 rules for dragon bloodspawn -
those creatures with a quarter dragon blood in their heritage - and
stats for a bloodspawn vampire.<BR><BR>Maps and damage rules for
navigating Storamere's lair, a semi-solid palace made of a dangerous,
corrosive liquid and located in another plane.
