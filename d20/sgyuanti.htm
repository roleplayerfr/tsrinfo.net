<center><b>Chaos Amidst Order</b><BR><BR>The Yuan-Ti are often portrayed as
sadistic, malevolent creatures intent on dominating the world at all costs. The
very image of the scaly, humanoid reptiles with venomous fangs and wicked, yellow
eyes fills most people with dread. For Game Masters, this makes them the ideal
antagonists: Alien in both appearance and motivation, they easily, and with
little explanation, be dropped into any campaign or adventure as the fiendish
masterminds behind virtually every conflict the characters run up against.<BR><BR>
They are a society of long standing tradition, placing as much value in erudition
as other cultures might place in martial prowess. Players and Games Masters
alike will discover a wealth of possibility hidden within the vast empire of the
Yuan-Ti. For the inquisitive, there is a new culture to study; for the
diplomatically savvy there are new alliances and treaties to negotiate; and for
the bloodthirsty, there are new foes aplenty to kill.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will
