No one race or culture has the right to stand against Izrador and his foul
legates. The dwarves are valiant, but caged in their mountains. The elves
are skilled, but have neither the numbers nor the resources to fight off
the orc hordes forever. Yet there are some few who would join their
knowledge and skills, the better to fight the Shadow that has fallen over
both peoples.<BR><BR>And those few are hunted.<BR><BR>CROWN OF SHADOW is
a desperate quest across Eredane, ranging from the depths of the Kaladrun
Moutains, across the grim expanse of the occupied plains of Erenland,
through the secretive underground of the Eren River, and finally into
the heart of the Whispering Wood itself. The players, inexperienced
rebels in the fight against Izrador and the Night Kings, become the
unintended recipients of a valuable prize, the unwilling charges of a
deadly quest. The forces of the Shadow have uncovered a prize of their
own, however, and have given it to one of their most devious champions.
The party must elude this tireless pursuer and reach sanctuary a continent
away, lest they fall prey to the CROWN OF SHADOW.<BR><BR><center>An
adventure for 4 to 6 characters that takes them from 1st to 5th level</center>
