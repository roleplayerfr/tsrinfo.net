<center><b>Fallen Humans</b><BR><BR>The common ogre stands nine to ten
feet tall, smells like a dung heap and avoids direct confrontations. The
merrow resemble the land-bound cousins but breath water and swim like fish.
Finally we have the ogre mage, a creature somehow related to the common
ogre but remarkably different; although they share a similar physical
appearance the ogre mage represents a much greater threat than an ogre.<BR><BR>
The earliest depictions of ogres show them as large, degenerate human
beings. They may also possess animalistic qualities, twisted human
features or even radical deformities like useless limbs or extra eyes.
Although later stories and sightings elaborate on these original themes,
they remain true to them.<BR><BR>Evil and unpleasant, Ogres present a
fascinatingly complex engima. Large, powerful, yet innately cowardly,
Ogres represent all that is bad in humans themselves.<BR><BR><b>Inside You
