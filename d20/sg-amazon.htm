<center><b>HELL HATH NO FURY</b><BR><BR>Throughout history and legend,
amazons have always stood firm as the ultimate warrior women, the ideal
of female triumph in a male dominated world. But who are the amazons,
a race who counts the deepest jungles as their domain and ruthlessly
slays any intruder? The Slayer's Guide to Amazons peels back the fog of
myth and legend to reveal, for the very first time, the true story of
these incredible women.<BR><BR>With lithe, supple bodies and stunningly
attractive features, the amazons are deceptive to any outsider
encountering them for the very first time. Few make any mistake the
second time around if they survive this encounter, for amazons are
truly cruel and capricious, dedicated to destroying any influence the
outside world may have upon their civilisation. Far from being
primitive tribeswomen, amazons have a highly sophisticated culture,
devoted to the preservation of their warrior ideals at all costs. They
are superb combatants, for skill in the sword, spear and bow is impressed
upon each girl at an early age, and they ruthlessly protect their
domain against any invader.<BR><BR>FOR GAMES MASTERS AND PLAYERS ALIKE<BR>
