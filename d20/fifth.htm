No sooner than you announced your names to the guards who stood upon
the gates of Brynmoor, than you were rushed with all due haste to the
castle and told that you would soon be granted audience before the
king. Now you wait in the empty throne room.<BR><BR>A royal fanfare
sounds from unseen trumpets, and a concealed panel behind the throne
slips aside. A man who must be King Daqan steps through it and stands
before you. You see a sadness in his eyes that is well masked, but not
hidden.<BR><BR>"A fortnight ago a man was killed within the very walls
of this castle. And in the days since then one deadly murder after
another has been committed, and we have found ourselves helpless to
thwart them. We know the undead lie behind these horrendous atrocities,
but we do not know how or why. They strike without warning, entering
our most secure chambers.<BR><BR>"Then, two days ago..." His voice
trails off, and he stands motionless through a tense silence.<BR><BR>
"Two days ago, my daughter was kidnapped from her chambers. They have
taken her. I know not where. I..." His voice breaks, and his face
twists in anguish. Then, as quickly as the moment came, it is gone.
His voice is that of granite and steel, and his eyes pierce deeply into
your own.<BR><BR>"My first knights fight against the hordes on the
frontier, and I fear that there remain none within this city with skill
enough to save us from this evil which has descended upon our realm.
Will you help us?<BR><BR>"Will you help me?"
