<center>Wizards. Unique magicians with the patience, discipline and mental
prowess necessary to twist the fundamental forces of the universe
to do their bidding. Wizards must work hard for their power -
unlike other spellcasters who receive their magic as intuition or
inspiration, a wizard studies, toils and labours to find the correct
formulae for his spells, experimenting and researching without rest.
The path of a wizard is incredibly flexible, allowing him to choose
his own style of magic; he can become a master craftsman that can
construct any magical items, specialise in a school of magic to
increase his power in a certain area, or seek to qualify for one
hundred and one prestige classes that deal with arcane acumen. The
wizard is the unparalled master of magic, capable of wrenching the
secrets of the universe from the firmament.<BR><BR>With the help of
this sourcebook, any character choosing the wizard class will find
many alternatives and options expanding his range of abilities.
With certain career paths, wizards can customise their advancement
and gain special benefits from their chosen branch of training.
Legendary classes offer a subset and expansion of their magical
prowess that may thake them to epic levels and beyond. Multiclassing
offers a wizard a complement to his abilities, while spell research
and offers a complete system for wizard characters to create their
own personalised spells. Also included is a complete system for
creating and running magic schools, abodes of learning and research
as well as established authorities on all things arcane.<BR><BR><b>
