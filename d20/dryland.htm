Dry Land: Empires of the Dragon Sands takes you on a tour of the Dragon Sands
region dominating the southern part of the Great Northern Continent in the
Bluffside Campaign Setting. Hundreds of miles south of the bustling metropolis,
this area is known for extremes of heat, aridity and other dangers, both
natural and supernatural. Journey into a land where normal groundwater can
kill as easily as a rampaging dune wyrm. Explore ancient ruins and the skeletons
of giants. Tremble at the mighty power of the genies and those who serve them.
