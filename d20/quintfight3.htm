<center>Once the dust clears after a battle, the fighter can stand
proude, wipe the sweat from his brow and be grateful for the skill
and training that allowed him to keep himself alive and vanquish
his foes. The field of battle is the home of the fighter, the class
that is best suited for combat, showing depths of training that
outshines a barbarian's power and rage, the paladin's righteousness,
the monk's discipline and the ranger's instincts. Fighters have a
wide range of options, with more paths and choices open to them
than any other character class, for it is they who can decide how
they will approach combat, and what abilities they will learn.<BR><BR>
With the help of this sourcebook, any character choosing the fighter
class will find many alternatives and options for expanding his range
of abilities. With career paths, fighters can customize their
advancement and gain special benefits from their chosen branch of
training. Legendary classes offer a subset and expansion of their
combat prowess that may take them to epic levels and beyond.
Multiclassing offers a fighter a complement to his abilities, while
superior tools can enhance his performance. Tricks of the Trade
expands the range of tactics a fighter can use on the field, while
weapon mastery and attack moves describe a series of advanced
techniques that a fighter can master for even more devastating effects.<BR><BR>
