<center><b>CURIOUSER AND CURIOUSER ...</b></center><BR>A quest to destroy
cursed artifacts leads a party of adventurers into a mirror world, where
the laws of reason and magic have been radically twisted. Feral gnomes
and savage halflings prowl the forests alongside warlike humans and
barbarous elves, while peaceful goblins, orcs, and ogres farm the land,
always fearful of another brutal attack. Only the divine protection of
the sacred undead keeps the bloodthirsty hordes at bay.<BR><BR>The PCs
must find their way out of this strange world before it destroys them ...
but on the way, they have to deal with their suddenly new and unfamiliar
abilities, and face their own altered personalities.<BR><BR><i>The Ebon
Mirror</i> is a D20 System adventure designed for characters of 8<sup><font size="-1">th</font></sup>
through 10<sup><font size="-1">th</font></sup> level. It includes:<BR><BR>
Information on the Crucible of Osai, an order dedicated to preserving
the flow of magic by destroying "flawed" artifacts - both dangerous
cursed items and frivilous magical objects - that waste magical energy
and upset the balance between matter and magic.<BR><BR>18 magic items
and minor artifacts, with alternate rules for use in the mirror world.<BR><BR>
Stats for the sacred undead - the remains of those humanoids with a
glimmer of goodness in their souls, and so brought back by the gods to
atone for their sins. They are charged with divine light and make true
the phrase, "the only good human is a dead human."<BR><BR>A new monster
called the antisphinx, with the body of a woman and the head of a lion,
whose riddles block escape from the mirror world.<BR><BR>A complete
rules appendix for conversion of spells and magic items into their
mirror-world antitheses.<BR><BR><center>Requires the use of the Dungeons
