This companion book to Green Ronin's <a href="bowblade.htm"><i>
Bow & Blade</i></a> fully details a wood elf village designed to fit easily
in any fantasy campaign setting. The remote tree-top village makes an
excellent home base for a wilderness-oriented campaign, or an exotic place
for existing characters to visit. The current political and religious
crisis offers a starting point for play, while the many adventure seeds
and plot hooks ensure that Corwyl will remain interesting for the life of
the campaign. <i>Corwyl: Village of the Wood Elves</i> also includes:<BR><BR>
<ul><li>A complete history of the village, including details on the Dark
War with the drow fortress of Dezzavold.</ul><ul><li>Over 40 fully
detailed NPCs.</ul><ul><li>Two new core classes (Ancestral Speaker and
Terellian Knight) and two prestige classes (Animal Master and Tree Maiden)
tied to the village's background.</ul><ul><li>A plethora of new feats and
spells, complemented by choice additions from a variety of open sources.</ul><ul><li>
Rules fully in line with the 3.5 revision.</ul><ul><li>A handy "Who's Who?"
appendix to make the GM's job easier.</ul><ul><li>Beautiful art from Andrew
Baker, Jennifer Meyer, Jonathan Kirtz, Stephanie Pui-Man Law and Liz
Danforth.</ul><i>Corwyl: Village of the Wood Elves</i> is both evocative
and useful, with something to offer any d20 fantasy campaign. Enter the
forest, and see what mysteries it holds!
