<center>The first in the new 'Classic Play' series from Mongoose Publishing,
<i>The Book of Strongholds and Dynasties</i> cover one field of central
importance to any d20 game in unprecedented depth and detail. This series
will form a collection of definitive works on subjects relevant to any
gaming group.<BR><BR><i>The Book of Strongholds and Dynasties</i> is not
just another book about castles. All too often, the world 'stronghold'
means only one thing, namely the typical stone keep on top of a hill,
complete with crenellations and arrow slits in its walls. It is an
enduring image from fantasy literature and cinema. As such, it is rarely
explored in depth.<BR><BR>Here you will find not only the lore of castles,
but dozens of other strongholds and other buildings, enough to build all
the major features of a city. Everything from the humblest farmhouse to
the mightiest palace is covered between these covers.<BR><BR>Having
harvested the resources or had them delivered to you by professional
builders' guilds characters can build anything from a log cabin of wood
to a towering fortress of crystal. Rules found herein cover the
transformation of an ordinary manor house into a fortified tower or the
skull of a dead god into a homely retreat.<BR><BR><i>The Book of
Strongholds and Dynasties</i> unveils the Open Governmental System, a set
of game mechanics that allows player to establish themselves as kings,
princes, potentates, dictators, generals, theocrats and governors. After
they have made their fortune as an adventurer, they can now try their hand
as a monarch or a politician. As a despot, governing with force, a
plutocrat using your wealth to buy your way to power or a High King
uniting the tribal warlords of a battle-ravaged country with nothing but
your powers of leadership they must learn to wield new kinds of power.<BR><BR>
An expanded and updated version of the Open Mass Combat System version II,
completes this tome of architectural lore. After all, what use are rules
for building strongholds without some rules to smash them down with!<BR><BR>
