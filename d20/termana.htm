FAR LANDS<BR><BR>Distant from Ghelspad, Termana is the second major continent of
the Scarred Lands to be described in Gazetteer format. Here, the wicked
charduni dwarves challenge the forces of good, and exotic kingdoms rise and fall
in the wake of the Divine War. This book includes a history of the continent,
and the role it played in the struggle against the titans, information on its
diverse kingdoms and cultures, and an overview of its many unique geographical
features.<BR><BR>Scarred Lands Gazetteer: Termana provides sufficient
information to start a campaign, or as an exotic homeland for characters and
NPCs. Termana is also an excellent change of pace for adventurers from a
Ghelspad-based campaign.</center>
