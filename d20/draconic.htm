This book contains more than thirty new species of dragon with which to torment,
tempt, and delight your players. Will they face the awe-inspiring might of the
dire dragon or cower before the mind-destroying horror of the chthonian dragon?
Perhaps one of them will be lucky enough to acquire the loyal and fearless
guardian drake as a bodyguard, or ride across the planes of existence on the back
of the regal planar drake.<BR><BR>The dragons in this bestiary were created to
fill specific roles in your campaign. Whether you need a particularly
challenging encounter to spring on your players or just want to add a touch of
exotic flair to your world, <i>Draconic Lore</i> has just the dragon you need.
