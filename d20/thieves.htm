<center>ONLY TRUE HEROES WILL FIND HONOR AMONG THIEVES.</center><BR>
They lurk in the Ralferst Forest, striking out at all who pass through,
robbing traders, assaulting farmers, even killing with impunity.
Working from a secret base deep in the forest, a band of thieves has
struck fear into the heart of Brandon's Bridge, the little village at
the crossing of the Azure River. But now a band of heroes has come,
seeking glory and adventure - heroes that might just be up to the
challenge of driving away the Thieves in the Forest.<BR><BR><i>Thieves
in the Forest</i> is a beginner-friendly, introductory adventure for
the D20 System. It features:<BR>A wilderness adventure segment set in
the Ralferst Forest, a dense wood crisscrossed with paths and fraught
with perils. The nature of the forest and paths makes it easy for
less experienced players and GMs to deal with this non-dungeon
environment.<BR>A double-sided, fold-out poster map (17" x 22") of the
thieves' hideout - an ancient ruined temple - suitable for tabletop
use with miniatures or counters, for easier handling of tactical
combat.<BR>Maps created in Profantasy Software's Campaign Cartographer
2, and available for download on the Atlas Games website (<a href="http://www.atlas-games.com/">
www.atlas-games.com</a>). GMs can customize and manipulate these maps
themselves, if they own CC2, and integrate them into their own game
worlds.
