<center><b>A compendium of horrifying new undead from your darkest nightmares.</b></center><BR>
Following in the footsteps of <a href="draconic.htm"><i>Draconic
Lore</i></a>, this book contains more than thirty new undead, with half a dozen
templates among them. These ghastly creations will haunt your players' dreams
for years to come. They can cower before the soul-destroying power of the
necroelementals, or flee before the mind shattering horror of the atrocity
wight. Only a lucky few will survive to seek help from the guiding spirit and
legion of the dead, but those who fall in combat may rise again as a forever-jack
or an eternal confessor.<BR><BR>The undead in this bestiary were created to fill
specific roles in your campaign. Whether you need a particularly challenging
encounter to spring on your players or just want to add a touch of exotic flair
to your world, <i>Necromantic Lore</i> has just what you're looking for.
