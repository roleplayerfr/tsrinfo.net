<center><b>A Treasury of Nautical Lore</b></center><BR>No place offers more
adventure than the ocean. No dungeon is as deep, no jungle as full of
exotic and dangerous life. Most folk spend their entire lives on dry
ground, unaware that entire civilizations thrive beneath the waves, sometimes
far more ancient and steeped in mystery than any on the world's upper
surface. Though player characters have long grown familiar with the
air-breathing world above, seldom do they venture into the depths, and
when they do, they discover wonders they never dreamed existed. The ocean
offers a venue for adventure that is at once alien and appealing. Strange
things exist down there, as perilous as they are compelling.<BR><BR><center><b>
Maritime Adventure</b></center><BR><b>Dead Man's Chest</b> lays bare the
ocean and the creatures that inhabit it. Within these pages are detailed
rules for ship movement, as well as guidelines for underwater exploration,
and three complete maritime adventures. At last there is a comprehensive
source for sailing and the sea - packed with over 100 new magic items,
monsters, feats, prestige classes, and spells.<BR><BR><center><i>Requires
