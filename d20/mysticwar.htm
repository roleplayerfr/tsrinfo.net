<center>HERESY! Brothers, we are concerned with the growing influence
and power of heretics - these so called mystic warriors. The common
folk hold them as saints and heroes. Our very church has been infested
with a number of these corrupt individuals. Do not think for a moment
that these abominations are not dangerous to our very foundation. They
dare to tap into their own souls for power, rather than look to the
gods. Their schools are spreading like a plague. We must root these
treacherous villains out and show them to the world for what they really
are, HERETICS!<BR><BR>Brother Cristoff d'Angiou<BR>Sermon to the Faithful,
All Father Festival<BR><BR>Hunted and feared by the Pantheon. Praised
and revered by the commoners. In the world of Gothos, there are
hidden sects and secret schools where the most powerful arts of war
are learned and perfected. Great masters have studied the most ancient
ways of fighting, passed down through the ages, and tied it to the most
powerful source of energy, the very spirit and soul of life.<BR><BR>In
this d20 supplement book, 20+ schools of Mystic Warriors are presented,
each with its own unique history and abilities. These special prestige
classes can easily be adapted to any campaign setting, as well as the
schools of the Mystic Warriors themselves.<BR><BR><b>Requires the use of
