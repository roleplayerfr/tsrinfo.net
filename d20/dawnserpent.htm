Night has fallen and the darkness presses in like walls as you ride
along the forest road. The thin sliver of a moon above does little to
dispel the gloom. A chilling wind gently stirs the leaves and the
crisp air stings your exposed flesh. Your breath hangs in the air
forming small halos around your heads.<BR>Rounding a bend you see the
cheerful glow of a campfire about a hundred yards ahead. You can make
out the silhouettes of three figures standing around the welcoming fire.
Eager to warm yourselves and perhaps share some cameraderie with
fellow travelers you urge you steeds on.<BR>As you approach, a feeling
of uneasyness settles in the pit of you stomachs. The forest around
you is ominously still. An oppressive silence fills the void... as if
the entire forest is holding its breath expectantly.<BR>Upon closer
inspection the figures surrounding the campfire appear to be extremely
life-like stone statues, their faces frozen masks of fear or surprise.<BR>
Examining the campsite, you notice a pair of deep, parallel grooves in
the loamy soil leading into the brush to the north as if something
heavy has been dragged away...
