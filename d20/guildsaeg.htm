decree, I sat back and watched as my guildsmen made their way from the hall.
My advisors crowded around me, waiting for privacy before speaking. Gerus
Duhrg was the last man out, he always was, and gave me his trademark
second-glance and knowing smile.<BR><BR>I just wish I knew what it is I'm
supposed to be in the know about.<BR><BR>I listened subconsciously as my
advisors and master craftsmen gave their opinions, reports, and plans.
Everything passed my danger threshold and I nodded my approval in turn.
All that remained was the dues collector...<BR><BR>And he was smiling.<BR><BR>
It's good to be the guild master.</i><BR><BR>-Jerron McClurg, Guildmaster
to the Blacksmith Order of Vulcan<BR><BR><b>THIS IS THE KEY TO THE CITY<BR><BR>
