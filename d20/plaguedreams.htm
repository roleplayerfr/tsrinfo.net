<b>It seems simple enough.</b><BR><BR>Enter the abandoned fortress, track
down the bandit spies, retrieve the treasure and collect the reward. But
this simple task is only the first piece in a complicated puzzle, the
first step in an adventure filled with intrigue and betrayal, where
answers fade faster than ancient memories.<BR><BR>As the larget picture
comes into focus, the heroes realize that a more complex mystery is at
hand, focused on far more than some stolen treasure. When allies become
enemies and simple assignments become epic struggles, the characters will
have to tread carefully as they navigate between deadly bandits and
dangerous outcasts. Will the heroes act as unwitting pawns in this
contest of wills, or will they succeed despite the odds and prevent the
plague of dreams?<BR><BR><center>This adventure requires the use of
