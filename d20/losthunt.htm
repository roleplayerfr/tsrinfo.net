The elves of the village welcomed you with open arms, and have
demonstrated a kindness and generosity that you have sometimes come to
doubt still existed in the world. Now, as you gather among the dappled
shadows of the village green - a good night's rest and a hearty
breakfast comfortably behind you - a band of children dances about
your legs, and a gentle sense of tranquility settles around your soul.<BR><BR>
No sooner has it arrived, than the moment is torn asunder by a sudden,
piercing scream that echoes from the far side of the small village.
Your heads turn as one in its direction, but before you have even a
moment to react, you see a black form hurtling through the air toward
you. As it crashes to earth scarcely twenty feet away, you realize it
to be some monstrous humanoid - and you marvel at the stunning strength
of the mighty legs that propelled its massive body through the air.<BR><BR>
That which follows seems to stretch for an eternity, although it must
last scarcely more than a moment: The creature turns with lithe and
sinister ease, and with a casual strength eviscerates the nearest
villager with a single, terrible claw.<BR><BR>A shocked silence fills
your ears.<BR><BR>And then you hear a sound. You realize it is the
children screaming all about you. If the twisted, blackened hide of
the creature left any doubt in your mind as to the unnatural blasphemy
of its existence, it is eradicated now. The cry for action churns in
your stomach, and the creature is already turning to a new victim...
