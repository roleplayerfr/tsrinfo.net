<center><b>Magical Swords, Powerful Villains:<BR><BR>When the two meet, all hell
breaks loose!</center><BR><i>Swords of Evil</i> presents 22 of the deadliest
artifacts ever created, each held by a villain powerful enough in his own
right - though whether they control their swords or their swords control them is
entirely a different matter! Each weapon has a secret of its own and is carefully
guarded by a force of villain that could - and have - toppled entire kingdoms!<BR><BR>
<ul><li>Each of these incredibly powerful, and exceptionally vile, weapons is
described in detail, with an emphasis on its motivations and magical powers.</ul><ul><li>
No sword could be complete without a warrior to wield it, including even these
potent relics. Those who possess these malevolent blades are themselves
powerful and reviled scourges, and are described in detail right along with
their blades.</ul>Every villain needs a lair, and these formidable individuals
are no exception! When they are not conquering and spreading their malevolence,
they are choosing their next targets here. The inner sanctums of each of these
cruel foes is described in just as much detail, giving Dungeon Masters and
Players alike a full gaming experience!</b><BR><BR><center>Evil stalks the
land in the form of incredibly powerful magical blades. These weapons each
have their own deadly agendas and command nearly unstoppable powers. The only
force standing in the way of ultimate destruction is you. Are you ready to
take up the challenge and test your metal against the deadliest of evil
blades?<BR><BR>Fast Forward Entertainment assembled an incredibly talented
group of authors, including winners of the pretigious Origins Award, to bring
you this unique accessory. Together, Johnathan Cassie, Kurt Hausheer, Tim
Kidwell, Kevin Melka, Stephen D. Sullivan and James M. Ward have crafted a
book that will bring Dugeon Masters and Players alike hundreds of hours of
enjoyment!</center>
