<center><b>MEchs for Enemies and Allies</b></center><BR>Survival in
DragonMech requires a hard metal shell powered by a loud engine. But it's
not enough to beat the other mechs: you also have to survive wizards
throwing fireballs! This is the definitive guide to the smoke-belching
steampunk mechs, nimble clockwork lancers, slave-driven galley-riders,
magical elven tree-walkers, and grotesque necromechs that every mech
jockey has to be prepared to pilot - or fight.<BR><BR><center><b>A New
Kind of Fantasy Warrior</b></center><BR>This "monster manual of mechs"
provides players with new options and DMs with new enemies. There are
more than 50 new mechs, plus new monsters, gear, and NPCs. In
non-DragonMech fantasy worlds, the mechs can be used as deadly constructs
or animated golems.<BR><BR><center><b>Designed for use with <a href="dragonmech.htm"></a>
DragonMech, The Mech Manual includes</b></center><BR><ul><li>59 new
mechs from all known areas of the DragonMech world: the major factions of
dwarves, elves, orcs, and undead, as well as races that are only just now
beginning to experiment with mechs, such as drow, derro, and aboleths.</li>
A dozen new monsters for your DragonMech game.<li>Endless adventure ideas,
whether based on the stories behind the new mechs or the unique NPCs who
pilot them.</ul>
