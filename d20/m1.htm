<center><b>To Kill a King...</b></center><BR>Death to King Ovar the
Tyrant! Life to Law and Order! Four characters are charged with a
mission so insane, so daring, that terming it an assassination does
not do it justice. Are the four volunteers who would lay low King Ovar
assassins? Or are they heroes? If the former, how are they better
than the madman they are assigned to kill? And even if they are the
latter, will their heroism be enough to overcome the Maze of Zayene?<BR><BR><center><b>
Snared in the Wizard's Web</b></center><BR><b>Prisoners of the Maze</b>
is the first part of the <b>Maze of Zayene</b> series by Robert J.
Kuntz, an award-winning author and co-creator of the world's most
popular roleplaying game! This module describes Zayene's dungeon maze
in which the characters are trapped and the many new magics and monsters
he has placed within it to defeat those imprisoned there. The wealth
of adventure detail will energize any campaign and serve as a starting
point for many subsequent adventures. Can your players survive the
maze to complete their final mission, or will they become permanent
residents of the Maze of Zayene?<BR><BR><center><i>A fantasy adventure
for 4 to 6 characters of 9th to 12th level.</i></center>
