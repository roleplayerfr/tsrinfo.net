A small oasis lies along a major trade route through the desert, and
The Desert Beetle Inn is not only the most popular establishment in the
area, it is the only one! A favorite of merchants and travelers alike,
anyone with enough gold can explore their every desire.<BR><BR>Most
travelers fail to notice the small items that have gone missing. They
manage to ignore the strange sounds in the surrounding desert. And the
twisted footprints occasionally seen near the water hole mean nothing.
Hushed tales of missing children are laughed away.<BR><BR>That is, until
an important young girl disappears somewhere along the trade route...
the teenage daughter of a wealthy merchant. With the gold and the will
to find his missing child, he intends to stop at nothing to secure her
safety.
