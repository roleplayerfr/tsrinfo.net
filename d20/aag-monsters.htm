Sky ships, flying castles, cloud cities, and airborne monsters: all this and more
awaits you in the Aerial Adventure Guides. These stand-alone sourcebooks contain
new character options, races, monsters, feats, items, and adventure ideas,
plus aerial combat rules and sky ship design guidelines. Best of all, the aerial
adventure guides can be integrated into any fantasy campaign - after all, no
matter what world sits at ground level, anything can float above.<BR>The series
is divided into three volumes. The first covers rules, the second cover
settings, and the third covers monsters and items. Each of the three volumes
can be used independently, or they can be combined and used together.<BR><BR>

Guide series. It includes everything needed to populate the sky lanes of your

gnomish autogyros and zeppelins to undead hulks, halfling villageships, and orc

dragons, and golems of the air, as well as flying beasts like the plague vultures
and rain sprites.<li>New magic items suited to aerial adventures round out the
mix.</ul><a href="aag-rulers.htm">Volume One, Rulers of the Sky</a>,
