<center><b>The Hour of Destiny is at hand!</b></center><BR>
In only three days, Sealord Drac will unveil the lighthouse known
throughout Freeport as Milton's Folly. It's a race against time, as
the PCs must discover the hideous purpose of Drac's creation before it
is too late. Will the Brotherhood of the Yellow Sign summon forth the
Unspeakable One once again, and send Freeport to a watery grave? Will
Milton Drac turn himself into a dread god, and harrow the world with his
malefic power? Or is the Sealord just a dupe of the Brotherhood, to be
sacrificed for the greater evil of the Yellow Sign? These rumors and
many more are whispered on the streets of Freeport, while foreign ships
by the hundred sail into port for the lighthouse's debut.<BR><BR><i>
Madness in Freeport</i> is the action-packed conclusion of the Freeport
Trilogy. The city's fate hangs in the balance, and only swift and
heroic action by the PCs can foil Drac's sinister plan. Freeport will
never be the same.<BR><BR><i>Madness in Freeport</i> is brimming with
information and adventure. Within these pages you'll find:<BR><BR><center>
The secret of Milton's Folly revealed at last! A history of the
Captain's Council and its role in the development of Freeport. A who's
who of Freeport's movers and shakers. Three new monsters. Complete
maps of the Lighthouse of Drac. Enough booty to make any pirate
jealous!</center><BR><b>About Freeport</b><BR>Freeport is an exciting
