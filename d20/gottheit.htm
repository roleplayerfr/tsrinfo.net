The surrounding darkness makes it difficult to see more than a few
yards in front of you. Mist billows around you, chilling your armor
and bones. Your road map shows that a traveller's rest is coming. Just
a few more miles and you'll be there.<BR><BR>A silhouette looms ahead,
the shapes of a village wall and inner buildings draw you closer. You
are almost there.<BR><BR>But there are no lights. Nothing to guide you.
The quiet is disturbingly eerie and the threat of an attack looms in
all directions. At the gate, no one stands guard and the city streets
are quiet and still.<BR><BR>"Desertion" comes to mind.<BR>"Abandoned"
and "derelict" are others.<BR><BR>The only indication that anyone lives
here is a single sign, hanging from the open gate.<BR><BR><center>Gottheit.<BR>
Population 1,200.</center><BR>As you stand at the gate, trying to piece
together the mystery, a low, still moan echoes from the village and
fills the surrounding air with dread.
