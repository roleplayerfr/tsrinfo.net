Are you caught off guard when your players decide to visit the
NPC blacksmith from four sessions ago? Do you have trouble
remembering whether an unidentified <i>potion of bull's strength</i>
is the blue one or the sparkly green one? And when was that
dwarven relgious holiday again?<BR><BR>A first-of-its-kind playing
aid, the campaign tracker is an essential tool for third edition
DMs. Gone are the days of paper scraps and loose-leaf notebooks!
The DM Campaign Tracker is a carefully designed booklet with
spaces to record all information about an ongoing campaign:
NPC stats, XP logs, session history, character reference, world
info, and more. Just as every player needs a character sheet,
every DM needs a campaign tracker!
