<center><b>POWER * MYSTERY * DESTRUCTION</b><BR><BR><i>You think you know magic?
Ha! Pulling a pointy cap over your head and wandering around town in your
bed robe does not make you a wizard.<BR><BR>I must admit the stars and moons are
a nice effect, the better to warn others of the foolish thoughts rattling in
your brain. You speak of magic, but you know nothing of true power. Perhaps
among the fools of this city you are numbered among the wise, but from where I
come, you are an apprentice.<BR><BR>Have you witnessed the power of the awakened
eye? Have you seen a madness mage warp reality with the pure force of his
twisted mind? Can you take a living creature as a sculptor handles clay and
shape a being of your own design? The flesh mages of the Forbidden Wind can.<BR><BR>
So tell me wizard. What is it you know about magic?</i></center><BR>- Dyrendrus

This sourcebook expands on the basic magic system used in fantasy campaigns
to introduce a wide range of options. It introduces new classes that use
magic in unique ways. It presents two completely new systems for handling
magic - a spell point system that replaces the existing slot and level system,
and a freeform system that allows you to craft spells on the fly. Additional
rules allow you to customize magic items and infuse souls into artifacts.<BR><BR>
It's time to put the magic back in magic.<BR><BR>THE SECRETS ARE YOURS</b></center><BR>
