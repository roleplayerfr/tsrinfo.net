<center><b>Terror from the Depths!</b></center><BR>The duchy of Thessalaine
is under siege. Fishermen and merchants set sail into the Gulf of Irul
Kinthé and never return, leaving the port city of Harwynn's Shoal
weeping for lost husbands and sons, and desperate for lost revenues.
Pleas sent to Ellgrym's court, begging for aid, are ignored; for
Madradur, the duke's capital city, has its own problems. There, the
nights are no longer safe to walk; the streets and the sewers swarm
with creature from the depths: Grimlocks, orcs, and other, more hideous
horrors. And leading them, cloaked in shrouds of darkness, the drow.
Nightly, Duke Ellgrym's soldiers are beaten back by these attackers
from beneath, and none know why they come or where they strike next.
No men are available to investigate the vanishing ships from Harwynn's
Shoal.<BR><BR>One beleaguered province with two very different problems.
One stalwart group of heroes, who may have bitten off more than they
can chew, caught up in them both. From caverns deep beneath the
sprawling city of Madradur to tidal caves along the coast of Irul Kinthé,
they must follow a trail of spilled blood, old hatred, and subtle clues -
clues that may just lead them to suspect that Thessalaine's "unrelated"
problems may not be unrelated at all. Clues that, if they're fortunate,
will allow them to solve the mysteries that surround them.<BR><BR>And
that, if they are not so fortunate, might lead them into the grasping
tentacles of the greatest underground horror of them all.<BR><BR><center>
Shadows Under Thessalaine is a D20 system adventure suitable for third
to fourth level characters.</center>
