along our borders for the most innoccent of reasons. I am present at the
holy emperor's command only to bear the most pressing reassurances that we
cannot be held accountable for any accidents or incidents that befall your
army. We know internal dissent wracks your lands, and we are aware that
your rumormongers seek to blame such disturbances on this holiness's
agents.<BR><BR>Even if you could produce such evidence, what would it
gain you? The empire's legions outnumber yours, our wizards can crush
your simple court magician with a thought, and the trade cartels need our
ports, not yours. Your armor and blade have have served you in your
youth, but now you are at our mercy. Hunting dragons has taught you how
to swing a blade, but you'll find this talents useless now. One man in a
sea of swords means nothing to an empire.</i></center><BR>-Myrril Machador,
