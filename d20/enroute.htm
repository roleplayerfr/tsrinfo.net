<center><i>On the Road to Adventure</i></center><BR>You've scoured the
dungeon, looted the dragon's horde, and lived to tell the tale of your
brave deeds. Now it's time to push on to the next village, where still
more fortune and glory await... but you still have to get there first!
On your path lie the centuries-old remains of forgotten wars, strange
hallucinogenic plagues, homicidal innkeepers, bloodthirsty magical
weapons, demonic livestock, not-quite-abandoned temples, sloshed spirits,
bands of thieving children, alien creatures, conniving bandits and
brigands, profiteering carneys, mischievous fey, and a host of other
obstacles to complicate your journey.<BR><BR><i>En Route</i> is a
collection of short encounters that GMs can easily insert into longer
adventures of their own design, or use as transitions between published
modules. <i>En Route</i> goes beyond glorified battles with random
monsters; the encounters strive to be innovative concepts that can
stand on their own merits, and that can be played in less than one
hour's time.<BR><BR>The <i>En Route</i> sourcebook includes:<BR><BR>
21 unique encounters ready to be played at a moments notice<BR><BR>New
magic items and artifacts like <i>fairy gold</i> and the <i>spirit mine</i>;
poisons and potions from ergot to <i>liquid sunshine</i>; weapons both
magical and mundane, some even created on alien worlds; the new spell
<i>idol's ally</i>; magic traps, monsters, and special abilities like
Permanent Invisibility, Rebirth, Engulfing Slam, Poltergeist, and
Drunk; new D20 rules for dealing with a shaken faith; and a mob of new
NPCs ready to captivate your players on short notice.<BR><BR>Quick
reference appendices arranged by new D20 material, encounter location,
and Encounter Level, to make finding the most suitable encounter or
your favorite crunchy bits fast and easy.
