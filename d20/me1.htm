<center>Welcome to the very first volume in the new <i>Monster Encyclopaedia</i>
series, a collection of tomes describing and detailing a veritable cornucopia
of creatures foul and fair for your dismay and delight. Within the pages of
<i>Ravagers of the Realms</i>, you will find a collection of over 200 new
monsters and beasts of all shapes and sizes, from the earth-shaking bulk of
the siege-beast to the miniscule yet truly sinister mummer. There are horrors
the like of which has never been seen before - demons wrought from pure rage,
vast undead that prowl the ocean depths and hags that harvest the teeth of
children to create their disturbing fortresses. There are allies in the
fight against evil - the glorious metal angels hailing from a world where
there is no organic life, the spirited anachras seeking to set right the
wrongs imposed on the innocent and weak, and the citywardens watching the
streets with a careful eye. There are courts of capricious fey, armies of
lethal constructs and legions of monstrous aberrations that should never
have seen the light of day nor been even conceived of in the minds of those
who made them. There are vengeful spirits, devious fiends and undead
thirsting after the deaths of all who live - literally, in the case of the
parched zombie.<BR><BR>This <i>Monster Encyclopaedia</i> describes all
these creatures and far more. Each monster is fully detailed with artwork,
provided with its own set of statistics under the 3.5 edition of the d20
rules and with descriptive text for a GM to read out to fearful Players
when they first encounter it. Monster listings are provided alphabetically,
by Challenge Rating and by type and sub-type, while an entire opening
chapter is dedicated to aiding GMs in how to best implement and use
monsters in a campaign.<BR><BR>With a selection of monsters spanning the
full range of Challenge Ratings, from the innocuous glitterwing at CR 1/4 to
the apocalyptic unraveller at CR 28, and featuring beasts and horrors for
all types of terrain from deep forests, fiery volcanoes, dank swamps to
even other planes of existence, this book holds a monster for any campaign
and any occasion.<BR><BR><BR>RECOMMENDED FOR PLAYERS & GAMES MASTERS ALIKE</center>
