Your party has received a royal decree from the kingdom of Azinth, a
small but prosperous principality on the edge of a huge mountain range.
King Ezred of Azinth has heard tales of your exploits and wishes to
speak to you on "a matter of some urgency." You have all heard rumors
of a war brewing between Azinth and an aggressive neighbor, the
kingdom of Kanshek.<BR>After an uneventful journey, you arrive at King
Ezred's palace. The imposing keep looks prepared for war: The ramparts
have been reinforced and the guards are all clad in utilitarian mail -
not the ceremonial armor one usually sees in peacetime. Ezred smiles
as you enter the throne room and beckons you to take a seat near him.
He's a tall, robust man with a graying beard, and though you can see
worry lines creased across his face, he greets you as if you had just
dropped in for tea.<BR>"I have a task which needs completion," he
begins, "and I feel that you have the proper mettle to see it through.
Five years ago, the snow began to fall in our northern mountains. It
has not stopped since. Our northern border has been cloaked in ice for
all that time, blocking the passes to our northern neighbors. We sent
parties up to clear them, but none ever returned. I believe that
Kanshek instigated this magical winter. Normally, it wouldn't have
been a problem - we had trade routes through other nations, and our
ports remained busy enough to support the economy - but this looming
war has but off many of our supply lines. We need the passes open to
get supplies and equipment from our allies.<BR>"A few days ago, I
received a message from an unknown party who claims he knows how to end
this five-year winter. He has arranged a meeting at an abandoned inn
near the highest mountain pass. I would send my own troops, but I
cannot afford to pull any from the front lines.<BR>"Will you help me
end this unnatural freeze? You must meet this man and do whatever it
takes to clear those passes. If you perform this task for me, you will
hae the eternal gratitude of the Kingdom of Azinth."<BR>Hope you brought
your mittens.
