<center><b>All the myriad secrets of magic...</b></center><BR>Wizards
study their academic magics in great halls of learning; sorcerers
discover their spells through innate talent; clerics call upon the
gods for divine favor. But what of those magic-users who delve into
more obscure mystic traditions? What of those who tap into the power
of the heavenly spheres, or awaken the secret essences of herbs to
distill potent magical concoctions? Those whose gift lies in drawing
spirits or elemental forces to do their bidding, or who can explore
the twisting paths of a dreamer's mind? What of those whose very
presence tampers with the familiar magic of arcane and divine spellcasters?<BR><BR>
All these find their place in <i>Occult Lore</i>, a sourcebook of
magical knowledge for D20 System players and GMs alike. Each of this
book's ten chapters explores a different avenue of magical study, from
the alchemist's quest for immortality through philosophical perfection
to the improvised rituals of sympathetic magic. Whether you're searching
for a new character concept, or looking for a few tricks to hide up
your favorite magician's sleeve, this is the book for you.<BR><BR><i>

laboratories of alchemists, astrologers and herbalists</ul><ul><li>More
