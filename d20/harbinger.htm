The most dangerous foe is the enemy you once called friend... The small
peaceful town of Brookvale lies in the sheltered forest curve of a wide
river, protected from weather by the sweeping arms of massive elm
trees. The town boasts a library, a cultural museum filled with
historical exhibits, and the temple of Ghesse, the River-goddess. Over
the mossy gate hangs the sign of the Royal Testament - the King's own
favor. It is a gentle place, where goodly folk spend time in craft-halls
and educating themselves through study. Under the watchful eye of an
old wizard named Calendrus, the town has prospered and grown. Until
now...<BR><BR>A dragon appeared within the forest, recently, ravaging
outlying villages and destroying everything in its path. It shows no
mercy, nor any interest in peace - it exists merely to kill and maim.
Yet the marauding dragon's hide shines silver in the sunlight - a color
that should stand for goodness and justice. Something must be terribly
wrong to drive a good dragon to slaughter innocent peasantry... and
the dragon is headed directly for Brookvale!
