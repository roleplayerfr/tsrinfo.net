<center><b>The Duke is Dead. Can You Save the Duchy?</b></center><BR>A
distant province on the frontier of civilization, Listonshire mourns a
beloved leader, cut down by a dark curse that bedevils the region with ill
luck, misery, an ambitious baron and all manner of hideous monsters. Its
people stay in their homes, and trade has ground almost to a halt. Only
a few know the truth: That one of the duke's heirs survives, and can
prevent the treacherous baron from taking the throne. Only these few
dare speak up and call for help. They only await stalwart heroes to
answer them.<BR><BR><center><b>An Unpredictable Quest in a Dozen Parts</b></center><BR>
Listonshire is designed as the ultimate adventuring ground. A dozen
different locations, wilderness and dungeon, full of conversation and
combat, stand between the heroes and success. To restore the ducal
family to power, they need find not merely the missing heir, but proof
of her right to rule, and evidence of the baron's deceit. They must comb
tree and hillside, lake and catacomb; face monsters both familiar and
utterly alien; and survive the wrath of the being from whose power the
curse is drawn: The Oinodaemon, Lord of Plauges.<BR><BR><i><b>The Doom of
Listonshire</b></i> contains a simple system of random determination,
allowing the DM to place the party's goals in various locations, making
this a different adventure each time it's played!<BR><BR><center><i>
