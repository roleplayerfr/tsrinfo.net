<b><i>NUISANCES HAS MORE</i> and is unlike any other fantasy RPG sourcebook!
It is a tribute to the early years of fantasy roleplaying games, a parody
of the current state of the genre, a manual for keeping cocky and
annoying players off balance, and a poignant philosophical expression of
the post-modern, 21st century worldview.</b><BR><BR>Highlights of this
wonderful book include:<BR><BR><ul><li>Hundreds and hundreds of aggravating
and awful things that can happen to players!<li>Original art by about a
half dozen fantasy artists!<li>Introduction of the Defect character
attribute - and fewer than 100 Defects!<li>Bunches of unsavory Feats!<li>
Several Archetypical Nuisance Chatacters, including Krust, Joebob, and
Amber!<li>Cursed and off-color magic items!<li>Scores of defective items!<li>
Many, many random d100, d12 and other Random Tables!<li>Rules that address
the special role of female characters in the game in a sensitive and
realistic way - including Feats like Nice Body and Defects like Bitch, Hot
Flashes, and Throws Like a Girl!<li>Some of the most annoying monsters
ever spawned, including the Decapussywhipper, the Dire Dwarf, and the
world-famous Jester Dragon!<li>Unfortunate NPC personality traits!<li>An
open game license!<li>More exclamation points than any other similar
product!</ul>
