<i>"My name is Corporal Tonfa and I am your commander for the duration. Our
assignment is the west side of the Astar Promenade. It's a pretty easy position,
but I plan on doing this by the book and my book's only got four simple rules:<BR><BR>
"One! Keep your eyes on the crowd! You wanna watch the parade, or flirt with
the pretty Muses, turn in your sash and bugger off.<BR><BR>"Two! You don't
move from where I put ya. If you see something, or something happens you can't
handle, raise your baton and I'll come to you.<BR><BR>"Three! Only Muses and
whisps are allowed to approach the parade. Don't worry, you couldn't keep them
out if you wanted to. But nobody else is allowed onto the promenade. Got it?<BR><BR>
Four! As long as you wear those sashes, you are part of the Grand Army, which
means that if you screw up, <b>you answer to me.</b>"</i><BR><BR>Framed for a
heinous crime, the player characters must race against time to prove their
innocence and save the Seven Kingdoms from disaster. With corrupt merchants,
Rajan spies and the whole army of the Seven Kingdoms in their way, players will
need to use all of their cunning and skill to overcome their enemies.<BR><BR>An
adventure for 3 to 5 players, The Weight of Water is the first in a new series
of adventure modules for the Talislanta Fantasy Roleplaying Game. Game
statistics are included for both the Talislanta 4th Edition and the d20 system.
