According to myth, Hell spewed forth a foul seed of its damned terrain
that took root in the world and yielded the ruined city known as Hell's
Reach. Once a prosperous trading port that harbored pirates, outlaws,
and worse within its walls, the gods themselves punished the city for
turning its back on its one-time patron diety and embracing decadence,
greed, and violence. A tremendous earthquake sundered the peninsula
that connected the city to the mainland, leaving it a half-flooded
island populated by small bands of desperate survivors. Hell's Reach
is now a dumping ground for criminals deemed too dangerous to ever allow
back into society and too likely to break free from prison.<BR><BR>Though
warships constantly patrol the waters around Hell's Reach, travel to and
from the city is not impossible. Smugglers and other criminals use
magical means to ferry weapons, armor, and other goods to the ruins,
trading such mundane items for poisons and worse. As a one-time
prosperous port, many fabulous treasures lie hidden within the city's
crumbling walls, and more than a few daring bands have ventured into
the city. Those that make it out speak of desperate bands of cannibals,
highly organized criminal gangs, and much worse that stalk the streets.
Yet these same survivors often return laden with gold, jewels, and magic.
