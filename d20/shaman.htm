<center><b>Demons and Evil Spirits beware!</b></center><BR>Often dismissed
as superstitous primitives by both the arrogant and ignorant, the
spirit-touched mortals known as shamans know secrets long lost to the
"civilized" world. Blessed - or perhaps cursed - with sensitivity to
the unseen, shamans are masters of the Spirit World, and powerful
additions to any adventuring party.<BR><BR><i>The Shaman's Handbook</i>,
by <i>Dragon</i> Magazine regular and <i>Shadowrun</i> novelist Steve
Kenson, introduces the shaman class to the d20 System, but that's only
the beginning! Other features include:<BR><BR><ul><li>New prestige
classes like the Ghost Guide, the Healer, the Skin-Changer, and the
Spirit Hunter.</ul><ul><li>A bestiary of spirits and ghosts, plus
several new monster templates.</ul><ul><li>New magic items, indcluding
charms and fetishes.</ul><ul><li>A primer on the Spirit World, and information
on real world shamanic traditions.</ul><ul><li>New skills such as
Trance and Dreaming.</ul><ul><li>Evocative illustrations by Mike
Vilardi, Toren "MacBin" Atkinson, Steve Lawton, Ken Capelli, Drew
Baker and Mike May!</ul><i>The Shaman's Handbook</i> is the first volume
of Green Ronin Publishing's brand new Master Class series. Each volume
in this bold new line of d20 sourcebooks introduces a new core class for
the d20 System - and provides everything you need to fully intergrate
that class into your campaign.<BR><BR><i>The Shaman's Handbook</i> opens
up whole new worlds for your heroes. Will you heed the spirits' call?<BR><BR><center><i>
