<center><b><i>An ancient race in the<BR>autumn of their influence...</i></b><BR><BR>
Ancient, alien, immortal, as<BR>angels to men, the elve have lived since<BR>the
world was young and magic was new. For<BR>millennia they have studied the arcane
arts, setting<BR>themselves apart from the petty squables of lesser folk.<BR>
What mortal could contest with the oldest and wisest of races,<BR>the most powerful
of all wizards?<BR><BR>Each HEROES OF HIGH FAVOR book contains a toolkit of
additional<BR>feats, skills, concepts, and prestige classes to explore your
race's favored<BR>class. ELVES features background information and role-playing
tips for ten<BR>unique elven prestige classes, as well as new feats and new
uses for old skills<BR>specific to elves and wizards.<BR><BR>New arcane feats
combine with new rules for specialist wizards to firmly<BR>establish elves as
the masters of the arcane. Add-on rules for ley lines and<BR>power nexuses
can be dropped into any campaign, granting the elves<BR>dominion over the
eldritch powers of the ancient world. Best of all,<BR>an extended appendix
presents concrete rules for new spell designs,<BR>taking much of the usual
guesswork out of the process.<BR><BR>HEROES OF HIGH FAVOR: ELVES is the<BR>
definitive sourcebook for elven player<BR>characters of every kind.<BR><BR><i>
