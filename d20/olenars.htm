The taverns here in Gellius are known for their ale, not their
mercenaries or their strange clientele. Which is why you find it
unnerving when the bartender points you out to a robed and bearded old
man. The stranger bows to the bartender, then turns and approaches
your table.<BR><BR>"Good evening, friends," he says in a thick accent
you've never heard before. "My name is Llivarron, and acolyte of our
Master Timmoran." His eyes flash with power as he says the name. "I
have need of your... unique services. For it takes a brave soul to
challenge the Black Band, and I hear that you are the bravest in all
of Gellius."<BR><BR>Seeing your interest, Llivarron takes a seat.<BR><BR>
"My fellow acolytes and I are pilgrims here in your land, traveling to
the site where the Master first learned the secrets of magic. Part of
our group, lead by the wizard Olenar, was to meet us here days ago, but
has disappeared in the forest between here and Bandur. I fear that
they have fallen to the scourge of the forest, the outlaws known as
the Black Band.<BR><BR>"I need you to find Olenar and the others,"
Llivarron says, desperation creeping into his voice. "And I'm willing
to make it worth your effort."
