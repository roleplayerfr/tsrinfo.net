There is a secret to every message, and a hidden truth in every riddle...
Traveling along the roads outside the peaceful province of Teshida. A
humble ashigaru youth runs toward you, kneeling in the muck and mud at
your feet.<BR><BR>"Please," he says, weeping. "Please."<BR><BR>He holds
up a scroll, sealed with the chop of the village of Caotang. On the
outside, written in poor calligraphy, is the word 'samurai.' Within,
there is a message. In sloped kanji, tilted and barely legible, the
message reads 'We have killed the Village Magistrate, so sorry. Town of
Caotang no longer can work. Awaiting sentence of death.'<BR><BR>Caotang
is a wealthy village. Its production of silk worms is renowned
throughout all of Kikumura Province, and without the yearly tithe from
the town, many master silk-makers will have no goods for sale when the
winter comes. The entire province will starve.<BR><BR>"I will take you
to Caotang," the ashigaru youth says brokenly. "And there, you must
administer the Emperor's justice... and destroy us all."
