<center>Ironically, for a character class that includes so much
versatility, rogues are all too often pigeonholed into very
narrow set roles. For some, the path of the rogue is not just a
way to make easy money by taking what is not yours, or a path to
the respect of your peers, who learn not to turn their back on you
for fear of what you might do. The true master rogue takes pride
in his work, determined to make more of himself than just another
corpse in cheap leather armour, and achieving heights of prestige
to which no other class can reach. The ideal rogue chooses his
fields of study carefully and practices meticulously, making
sure that his abilities complement one another.<BR><BR>With the
help of this sourcebook, any character choosing the rogue class
will find many alternatives and options for expanding his range
of abilities. With career paths, rogues can customise their
advancement with their chosen branch of training; legendary classes
offer an expansion of their character features that elevate them
to epic levels and beyond. Multiclassing gives advice on to how
best integrate two classes, while superior tools ensure that his
performance is unparalled. Insights are given into the use of
easily overlooked spells and additional magical items are described,
while the Gizmo is introduced as the last word in rogue equipment,
along with rules and expansions on criminal rackets, confidence
tricks and bank robbery.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</b><BR><BR>
