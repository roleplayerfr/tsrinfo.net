Freeport has withstood naval attacks, lethal magics, and forbidden
cults, but how will it fare versus the forces of Hell? Two hundred
years ago the army of the Inquisition silenced the infernal hordes on
the island of Devil's Cry. Now something stirs amidst the ruins and
Freeport needs heroes to ward off a new threat. This is the good fight
to be sure, but the legions of Hell are not to be trifled with. Do you
have what it takes to match swords and wits with Hell's elite?<BR><BR>
Return to Freeport, the city of adventure, in this stand-alone
scenario for characters of level 10-12. The rewards are great... for
those who survive!<BR><BR><i>Hell in Freeport</i> is 88 pages of non-stop
action featuring:<BR><BR>A dazzling array of encounters and challenges.<BR>
A stunning eight-page map insert done in full color.<BR>Two new monsters.<BR>
A special web enhancement with four new prestige classes.<BR>Devils,
devils, devils!<BR><BR><b>About Freeport:</b> Freeport is an exciting
