<center><b>Two Days to Live!</b></center><BR>Welcome to Om Amarna, and
the annual Horse Festival. It is a time of celebration, drinking,
haggling, and thanksgiving.<BR>Celebrate while you can, because soon the
peace will be shattered. And in its wake will come danger, suspicion,
and tragedy.<BR><BR>In this first adventure in the cursed land of
Tieros, beginning characters will be forced to work together in a race
against time to find critical answers in a crowded, diverse, and
paranoid city. Answers that will satisfy the Dark Guard and the Cult
of Justice. Answers that will save their own necks from the gallows.<BR><BR>
The Sword of Justice introduces Tieros, a land cursed bythe acts of an
ancient hero, bound by common fate, and diverse in culture and belief.<BR><BR>
In this adventure characters will become familiar with an exotic new PC
race, the dangers of practicing magic in Tieros, the fanatical Cult of
Justice who worships Law itself, and the ubiquitous Dark Guard, the
military power that protects and enforces peace.<BR><BR>Will you
survive your first adventure in Tieros, or will it claim your life?<BR><BR>
<center>The Sword of Justice is a d20 fantasy adventure for first and
second level characters.</center>
