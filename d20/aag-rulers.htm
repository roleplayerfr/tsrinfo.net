Sky ships, flying castles, cloud cities, and airborne monsters: all this and more
awaits you in the Aerial Adventure Guides. These stand-alone sourcebooks contain
new character options, races, monsters, feats, items, and adventure ideas,
plus aerial combat rules and sky ship design guidelines. Best of all, the aerial
adventure guides can be integrated into any fantasy campaign - after all, no
matter what world sits at ground level, anything can float above.<BR>The series
is divided into three volumes. The first covers rules, the second cover
settings, and the third covers monsters and items. Each of the three volumes
can be used independently, or they can be combined and used together.<BR><BR>
Volume One, Rulers of the Sky, covers the basics of aerial adventures. These
include:<BR><ul><li>A basic overview of the sky realms.<li>Three new races
that dwell in the clouds: sky elves, the evil arachial, and the barbaric
avians.<li>Two new prestige classes that are at home in the sky (Air Knight
and Sky Elf Battle Captain), as well as guidelines for how the core classes
operate in the air.<li>New feats specific to aerial adventures and the creatures
that dwell there.<li>Expanded rules for aerial combat.<li>Rules for building
and operating sky ships, the flying vessels that are the primary means of
aerial transport for wingless creatures.<li>Eight new monsters specific to
the cloud realms.</ul><a href="aag-sellaine.htm">Volume Two, Sellaine: Jewel of the Clouds</a>,
describes aerial settings, including the sky elf city of Sellaine. <a href="aag-monsters.htm">Volume Three,
Monsters, Magic, and Sky Ships</a>, includes everything needed to populate
the sky lanes of your campaign.
