<i><b>At Stake...</b><BR><BR>Two worlds of great natural beauty locked in
a struggle that threatens to destroy them both. Thraxis and Arril: blue
sisters sharing an orbit, with continents, seas, and life.<BR><BR>A world in
the midst of an Age of Majesty many believe will never end: nine diverse
Empires at the peak of magical and culturual achievement. A world that
has never known an Age of Darkness, where men and women push themselves
daily to greater heights. It is an age of innocence and hope, when
possibility knows no bounds.<BR><BR>Elder races untouched by the decay of
time; great monuments to man's resourcefulness and his hubris. Mystic
power waiting to be claimed, and a destiny still in the making. Dragons
ruling and empire; a land that can forge gods.<BR><BR><b>The Threat...</b><BR><BR>
The Canticle of Morningstar: an inscrutable living Prophecy that is either
a warning, or a malevolent force leading mankind towards annihilation.<BR><BR>
The world has become a beacon to those who wish to subvert, destroy or
command, and they are flocking here, bringing their alien wars in a bid
that will alter the course of history and the nature of reality. Celestials,
demons, devils, gods, and a sophisticated race called The Strangers compete
with men, elves, dwarves and halflings to recast this idyllic planet in
their own images.<BR><BR><b>Salvation...</b><BR><BR>This book, which
contains:<BR><BR><ul><li>Elder races of an ilk that have been banished from
most other worlds: 3 supernatural subraces of dwarf, 5 types of fey elves.</ul><ul><li>
Two new core classes: the artificer, commander of elemental spirits called
numina which animate devices of his own design, and the eidolon, champion
of the people and a hero to defy legend.</ul><ul><li>Rules for signature
and countersignature magics that allow GMs and resourceful players to
forge their own places of power. Strengthen yourself while hindering your
enemies.</ul><ul><li>A study on the Canticle, its threats, its potential,
and tips on how to keep players guessing.</ul><ul><li>A world made for
heroes of every description, where the greatest deeds are yet to be
performed.</ul><b>But everything comes with a price.</b></i>
