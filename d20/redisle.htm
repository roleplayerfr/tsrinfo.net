Having just finished your business in Desburg, you charter a ship,
heading for Galishor. The ship, Nora's Grace, is leaving today and you
have just enough coin to buy passage. Captain Daniels tips his cap and
welcomes you aboard, as porters show you to your rooms. The accomodations
are more than fair and you settle in for a long journey ahead.<BR><BR><center>
* * *</center><BR>"White Squall! Captain Daniels!"<BR><BR>A startled
cry is cut short as massive waves hammer the ship. The sound of wood
splintering fills your ears as the ship is buffeted by another wave.
Lightning explodes in the air as the gutted sky spills the contents of
its belly.<BR><BR>A storm is rising and the ship is a victim of the
sea's whim.<BR><BR>As you rush onto the main deck, a horrific sight
welcomes you. A monstrous wave towers above the ship. You scramble
for purchase as it peaks and plummets towards you.<BR><BR>The sea
engulfs <i>Nora's Grace</i>.<BR><BR>The last thing you remember is the
taste of salt water in your mouth and the shock of icy water swirling
around you.
