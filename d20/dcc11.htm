Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
The small town of Welwyn has been beset by a string of robberies. The
heroes are led to the natural cave system located at the bottom of the
town well, which they must explore to find the burglars. But once they're
in the cave system, things get much more difficult! The "burglars" turn
out to be mere pawns in a much darker game. To get to the source of the
crimes, the heroes must shrink themselves with <i>potions of improved
reduce person</i> and explore a series of dangerous rat warrens where
their prey is larger than they are!
If you enjoy this adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl Classics
series!
