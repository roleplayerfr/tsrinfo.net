Not all threats lurk in the wilderness, and not all dungeons lie far
from the realms of man. The gravest threats appear in the heart of
civilization, hiding beneath harmless veneers and waiting for the moment
to strike.<BR>You and your friends find yourselves in a large and
prosperous city, with coins in your pockets and time to burn. You spend
an evening engaging in revelry - drinking, gambling, dancing - then
stumble back home in the wee hours of the morning. Your path takes
you through a dark area of the city: the cemetery district, where fields
of graves jostle against ancient churches and family crypts. Off in the
distance somewhere, you hear a scream, but there's no way to tell where
it came from, so you ignore it. Rounding a corner soon after, one of
you stumbles over something in the dark.<BR>At first, you think it's
just a pile of garbage, but a closer inspection reveals something much
grislier: a human corpse, its face frozen in a rictus of fear. Several
stab marks ooze fresh blood from its belly, and its flesh is marred by
what appear to be acid stains. The skin is warm to the touch, and some
of the injuries still smoke. He's not been dead for more than a few
minutes.<BR>The body shifts slightly as you examine it, and for a moment,
you think the victim may still be alive. The the truth reveals itself:
Small, sinewy worms, colored a strange lavender, twist and writhe within
his clothes. They number less than 20 and seem to cluster near the
acid burns. A faint trail of slime leads from the body to an open grate
in the street, dotted with more of the strange, lavender worms. The
building above it, a towering wreck of a cathedral dedicated to someone
named St. Bethesda, has been boarded up for years, but if you listen
closely, faint noises can be heard beneath it.<BR>"Halt!" The clink of
mail, and the sound of running feet break up you examination. A squad
of city guardsmen - several blocks away but closing fast - flash their
lanterns in you direction.<BR>"Murderers!" the cry goes up. "Halt in
the name of the watch!"<BR>This doesn't look good.
