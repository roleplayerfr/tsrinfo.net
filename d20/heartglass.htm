<b>The Valiant Die at Midnight!</b><BR><BR>Upon the shores of Ihlsa lie
the Sea Towns, old burgs polluted by the pestilence of evil. Thieves
battle for their streets, while assassins stalk their midnight aisles.
Only the valiant can penetrate the darkness, upset the plans of an
undead lord, and retrieve the artifact he so ardently desires, the
Heart of Glass.<BR><BR>The Companion Book contains a complete adventure
for characters of levels 2 to 3, and details the complete fantasy setting
of the Sea Towns of Ihlsa, ready for play in the epic World of Erde or
for placement in any homebrew setting. In addition to their histories,
relevant personages, and forty-one encounter areas, you'll find:</center><BR>
<ul><li>A 16 x 21" double-sided map of the Sea Towns.<li>The Crna Ruk
prestige class, dread assassin-priests that bring new meaning to the
word cutthroat.<li>The Hlobane Orc monster race. Play or fight one of
these disciplined and devoted warriors of the most feared Orc nation.
<li>New monsters, spells, and magic items, such as the Soul Thief, the
Blood Runes, and the legendary Heart of Glass.</ul><center><b>Draw
