Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
In Temple of the Dragon Cult, the characters are called in to pursue a
dragon that the king's army was able to wound but not kill. It seems
straightfoward enough: The army tracked the dragon to its lair, and the
only thing the characters have to do is go in and kill it. But this
dragon has a devoted cult of dragonblood followers who worship its every
breath. Its lair is their temple - and they'll fight to the death to
defend their dragon-god...<BR><BR>If you enjoy this adventure, look for
the rest of the Dungeon Crawl Classics series!
