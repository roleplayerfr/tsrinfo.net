Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
In this adventure, Lady Elisabeth Pendour beseeches the heroes for their
help. They must recover a key that was on her husband's body when he
perished trying to clear an ancient tower. The tower was once a coastal
fortress, but now it lies in ruins, occupied by black-feathered rook
harpies who worship a foul carrion crow demon. Lord Pendour sought to
free his subjects from fear by clearing the rampaging rooks from their
nests. But he failed, and unless the heroes can recover his body and
the key upon it, the crow god will come for his wife, too...<BR><BR>If you
enjoy this adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl Classics
series!
