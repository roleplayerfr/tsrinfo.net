<center><b>Deadly Grace</b><BR><BR>Upon the waves, the ships of the elves
are now only seldom seen. Once the ancient race rules the oceans and
none dared challenge their mastery but now the new races have taken up
the challenge of the sea and sail with vigour to all corners of the
world. Many may have forgotten the elves, but their rules of the waves
has by no means been surpassed. The elves go to sea for many reasons;
to defend the waters of their nations, to trade with the lesser races
or to simply fare the unknown.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:<BR><BR>
Elves at Sea:</b><BR>Never before covered history and information on the
sea-borne clans of elves and their total mastery of the ocean. Covering
traders, explorers and warriors in exquisite detail, players and Games
Masters alike may discover the true secret behind the elves' supremacy
on the waves.<BR><BR><b>Crews:</b><BR>Elves do not hire out their
services to just any captain and even then can prove extremely expensive.
However, for the captain who will settle for nothing less than the very
best, gold cannot hire a better crew than one comprised solely of elves.<BR><BR>
<b>Weaponry:</b><BR>New shipboard weapons employed by the elves, including
the Heavy Ballista, Fire Tower, Bound Bolts and Naphtha Elven Fire.<BR><BR>
<b>Ships of the Elves:</b><BR>Nearly 20 new vessels are features,
covering the entire vista of elvish ingenuity in ship design. From the
glorious and rarely seen Sea Haven to the deadly fast Elemental Ram,
few pirates are foolish enough to challenge an elven fleet at sea, be it
from the explorer, trader or warrior clans.<BR><BR>FOR GAMES MASTERS AND
PLAYERS ALIKE<BR>Requires the use of the Duneons and Dragons <a href="../3e/phb.htm">
