In my experience, ogres are stupid, lazy creatures possessing little
more than a rudimentary intelligence. They are nothing more than
brutal killers, scavengers, and raiders, with a dim-witted hatred of
anything resembling civilization. However, I once overheard two of
them speaking among themselves of a legendary city, a place where ogres
and their kin could meet and trade without fear of harassment from the
more "civilized" races. They named this place Drahk'Suhl - a city
hidden beneath the ancient shoulders of a dormant volcano, at a gateway
to the Lower Earth. At that moment I vowed that I would find the
legendary Drahk'Suhl, or die trying.<BR><BR>I found Drahk'Suhl infamous
among giant races, a place where traders swap weapons and booty, where
food and drink are plenty, where underlings do one's every bidding, and
where gladiator pits slake the most bloodthirsty apetite.<BR><BR>One
might say the oppurtunity for adventure in such a place is great.
But this is true only for those with a brave heart, a keen wit, and
cunning wiles... a person such as myself.
