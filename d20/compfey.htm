<center><b>NOT OF THIS WORLD</b><BR><BR><i>From the faerie realms come
both wonder and terror...</i></center><BR>Mossy glades at dawn, still pools
never touched by man, rings of toadstools in the moonlight, castles of ice
in the clouds: these are fairy places, realms of the immortals. The fey
wander at the fringes of civilization, and dare to tread where no mortal
foot has ever been. They are beings of hope and tragedy, and there has
always been a subtle sadness that seems to surround them. Mortals believe
that they are creatures of life, and indeed they are, but not in the ways
mankind thinks.<BR>The fey are a diverse group, almost so diverse as to
defy classification. They have strictures placed upon them that manking
does not understand, which breed fear and mistrust. In some places the
fey are honored as near holy beings, while in others, they are slaughtered
as demons. Indeed both of these reactions can be justified, at times, but
the truth of the matter is often case aside in favor of irrational awe or
hatred.<BR>This book hopes to shed light on the fey, and to give the
reader a better understanding of these mystical beings. Why, for example,
can the fey not bear the touch of cold iron? Why must a dryad remain
tied to its tree? What significance do a satyr's pipes or a grig's fiddle
have? Why do the fey have a reputation for stealing babes from their
cradles? These questions, and many, many more, will be answered in the
pages of this book.<BR>The Complete Guide to Fey is a stand-alone,
world-neutral sourcebook covering everything you ever wanted to know
about fey. It covers all the conventional types of fey, as well as many
new kinds. It contains new races, classes, prestige classes, feats, and
spells, as well as an entirely new way of looking at the fey. The Complete
Guide to Fey can be integrated easily into any fantasy setting.
