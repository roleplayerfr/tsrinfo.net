learn to fight, but only the gifted can harness the raw potential of
creation. Those gifted with eldritch power bear the mark of something
more. Whether taught the divine rituals of the Gods or working ancient
arcane sorceries learned over millennia, the power of creation is in your
grasp!<BR><BR>This book is a comprehensive guide to making spellcasting
adventurers native to Arcanis. Every facet of the eldritch arts is explored,
