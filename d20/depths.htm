<center><b>Beneath the Waves, Darkness Waits.</b></center><BR><p>It was
the tritons who blew the <i>Nautilacrum</i>, the legendary horn of the
Sea God. The tritons believed the horn would decimate their hated
enemies, the sahuagin, but instead, the ancient artifact destroyed their
greatest city and tore open a hole in the very ocean herself.<BR><BR><p>
Eventually, ships full of careless surface-dwellers tumbled into the
magical vortex atop the triton ruins. One of them, a savage pirate
named Galt and his brutal crew, survived, and have created an incredible
haven for others of their ilk inside.<BR><BR><p>The few surviving
tritons have formed a desperate band of legionaires to reclaim their
ancestral home, but to do so they must battle ravenous sahuagin, ruthless
pirates, and a dark secret lurking beneath the "Depths of Despair" -
the ghost of a dead god!<BR><BR><p>The <i>Depths of Despair</i> is the
first in a series of D20 System setting books featuring isolated and
dangerous environments - "Hostile Climes" - that may be dropped into any
fantasy campaign! Inside is a detailed setting featuring a city at the
bottom of a whirlpool and the caverns beneath, new skills, feats, gear,
prestige classes, monsters, and a complete adventure to drop into your
campaign right away!
