Handbook,<BR>published by Troll Lord Games.</i></center><BR>The heroes come
across an ancient wizard's tower. The nearby keep has been reduced to
rubble over the ages but the tower is still in perfect condition. It is
surrounded by an impenetrable force field that cannot be breached - not even
by the ghost of the long-dead wizard, who has been trapped within for
centuries. Surely there must be great treasure within this magical abode.
But how to get to it?<BR><BR><center>This adventure was originally published
