<center>FIFTEEN CULTS, CHURCHES AND CABALS</center><BR>Even in a world
overflowing with magic, the mark of the gods is unmistakable. Some
mortals actively curry the gods' favor, serving their high ideals or
executing their blasphemous designs. Those whom the gods have touched
may be inspired, blessed, cursed - the saint and the prophet, the
genius and the madman, sometimes one and the same person.<BR><BR><i>
Touched by the Gods</i> is a D20 fantasy supplement that can enhance
any fantasy campaign. It is filled with information on religious and
secular orders, and the deities lurking behind them:<BR><BR>In-depth
background for every cult, secret society, and cabal. Included are
histories, dogma, holy rites and adventure seeds designed to let Game
Moderators introduce the mysteries of the occult into their own
campaign world.<BR><BR>New deities and the NPCs who would grasp their
power, holy weapons, clerical domains, spells, feats and prestige
classes, special attacks and abilities, fearsome monsters, creature
templates, magical and cursed items, and the clandestine rituals that
grant lowly mortals a small taste of godhood.<BR><BR><i>Touched by the
Gods</i> is the supplement that players and GMs have been praying for!
