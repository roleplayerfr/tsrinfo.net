Refugees from the village of Oester have been flooding the city, fleeing
from an unspeakable terror that has ravaged the northern settlement. Their
faces still show the horror they have endured, but their tongues are
silenced because of fear. Could it be a plague? Could a terrible monster
torment them? It is up to the adventurers to discover the cause of this
panic.<BR><BR>Little do they know a shadowy evil has risen from the dead
to possess the abandoned tower on a hill overlooking the village. Most
have forgotten about this sinister force, except the king. He knows his
family's past has come to haunt him and threaten his line's succession.
Do the adventurers choose to help hide his family's past and preserve the
monarchy or reveal the truth?<BR><BR>An adventure setting for character
levels 3.5</center>
