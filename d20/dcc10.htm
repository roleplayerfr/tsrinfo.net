Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
After arriving at a seemingly abandoned trading post, the heroes discover
to their horror that all the inhabitants have been transformed into black
trees! Upon further investigation, they find clues that lead them to the
hidden lair of Nockmort, a treant gone bad. Nockmort has been transformed
by the strange radiation of a meteorite he discovered, and now he is a
terrible force of evil. The characters must enter his sunless garden to
save the town. And along the way they just might discover fabulous
treasure...
If you enjoy this adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl Classics
series!
