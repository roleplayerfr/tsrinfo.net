It's a simple bodyguard job. The threat level is low, and the pay is
good. That's what the merchant said when he hired you. Then the
bodies started showing up, and every indication that your employer is
next, along with anybody associated with him - like you. Suddenly, the
job seems a lot more complex.<BR><BR>Everybody makes mistakes. It's a
part of life... and death. But when one of those mistakes leads to
murder, it's up to you to clean up the loose ends. Because the murder
didn't quite take, and now you're stuck right between a single-minded
undead revenge machine, and its prey. It doesn't eat, it doesn't sleep,
it doesn't negotiate. It kills. And you're right in front of the next
target. The term "underworld connections" just took on a whole new
meaning.
