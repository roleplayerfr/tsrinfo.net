<center>Treasure Hunters Only Need Apply</center><BR>Two hundred and
fifty years ago, the County of Elbard was a prosperous border realm
with a bright future. A decade later it all ended in a tide of blood
and fire, stormed by a goblin uprising. But when the smoke had cleared,
the three Treasures of Elbard, the symbols of the realm, had vanished,
spirited away by a powerful druid, his ranger ally, and the halfling
they had come to trust. They hoped to return them to the King.<BR>
Instead, they vanished into history.<BR>In the intervening years, many
adventurers risked, and sometimes lost, their lives seeking the three
legendary Treasures. None have succeeded. Will you be the first to
recover...<BR><b>The Treasures of Elbard?</b>
