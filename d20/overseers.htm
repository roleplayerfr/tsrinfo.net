Nearly 100 years ago, Lord Eriador wrested the lands from the hands of
evil and began a reign of unsurpassed courage, wisdom, and might that
lasted over three centuries. One day this great man of valor was called
onward to continue his battle for freedom and goodness on a higher plane
of existence. Leaving the responsibility of rulership to his faithful
overseer, he donned his magical shield, helm, and sword and traveled to
the Holy Mountain of Anduin to meet his destiny.<BR>Eriador left the
overseer with this solemn promise: if there ever arose a time of great
need, he would answer a summons from the Mountain of Anduin to come
back to vanquish any evil that dared to oppress his people.<BR>It is
now the reign of the third overseer. For years now, an evil mage has
been plaguing the land by sending forth hordes of evil humanoid minions
to oppress the people. The overseer has been forced to pay tribute to
the mage to protect his people. Life has become nearly unbearable for
his subjects.<BR>It has been over five years since the mage desecrated
the holy mountain by placing foul creatures in its depths to guard
against the possibility of the people seeking help from their nearly
forgotten champion.<BR>A fortnight ago, your party was gathered in a
secret council chamber to meet with the overseer himself. You felt a
spark of hope for the people of this land as the overseer told the
legendary tale of Eriador. He gave you the equipment you would need
and charged your party with the task of venturing into the heart of the
now monster-infested Mountain of Anduin to call back the people's great
hero, Eriador the Paladin. Although the three parties sent before you
had not returned, ridding the land of the mage seemed worth any risk,
and you eagerly set out on your quest. Now, standing before the
defiled mountain, you wonder if perhaps you were too hasty.
