Governor Drunn tosses a handful of gold coins on the table in front of
you. "This is what I'm talking about," he huffs.<BR><BR>The shining
coins are stamped with the image of a hand in a sack, rather than the
city's seal as you would have expected.<BR><BR>"It's the bloody thieves
and their damned guild that did it! They broke into the treasury a
week ago and emptied it of every last gold coin. Then they re-minted it
with their symbol and handed it out on the streets. We acted as
quickly as we could and confiscated whatever stolen coin we could find,
but it was impossible to get it all. To make matters worse, now
people are using it as legal currency in the markets - the traders from
outside the city don't know the difference. So now we look like the
bad guys for taking people's money and the blasted thieves look like
heroes - even though they've stolen the people's money from their
government and handed out only a small fraction of it.<BR><BR>"We've
had problems with this guild before and have made efforts to shut it
down. The City of Kaaliqar has even passed new laws with harsher
penalties for guild-related crimes, but things have only gotten worse!
Out own knights and guardsmen can do very little about the situation -
no one will give out any information about the thieves or the gold.
I'm relying on you to track down the thieves, capture them, and recover
the stolen gold.<BR><BR>"The thieves are passing out more gold every
day - you must act quickly!"
