<center><b>THE ROSE AND THE CHAIN</b></center><BR>Charduni dwarves once
commanded a vast empire that spanned two continents. The elves, with
mighty dragons as allies, were their only rivals. Then the charduni fell
from grace, abandoned by the god who had made them, while the elves
suffered a titan's curse and their own god was slain. So it has been
since the days of the Divine War.<BR><BR>Now, the lost god Jandaveos has
returned, lifting Chern's curse from the elves and filling them with new
hope. Meanwhile, the charduni rebuild in hopes of regaining their god's
favor and returning to the path of conquest.<BR><BR>This volume provides
full details on both races, their histories and their characters. An
invaluable addition to any d20 fantasy campaign, <b>The Faithful and the
Forsaken</b> provides useful new material for players and GMs alike.<BR><BR>
