In the province of Ling, Lord Yu has a problem: his mother. She's
pompous and elitist and undercuts his actions by controlling the
province guard. More recently, however, other problems started. Huge
rats began appearing in alleyways. A six-foot weasel was found in a
hen house. Worst of all, an overpowering stench poured out from the
drainage system. Lord Yu's guard, who have a touch of the lord's
mother's ways, have been too "busy" to approach the task of finding
out what is going on. Enter the adventurers, who, if they take the
promise of cash and glory, walk into one of the truly messy situations
of their careers.
