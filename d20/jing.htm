to the Grande Temple of Jing! You must be worthy indeed to be chosen
by my lord to pay visit to this, his home and shrine. Know brave souls
that fame and fortune lurk around every corner of this magnificent temple.
Soon it's halls shall be yours to explore and plunder, but be warned.
Death and destruction also await in the rooms and corridors of the Grande
Temple, and only the skillful and cunning may survive to claim it's
rewards. Your destiny awaits you... in a moment. First I require a
volunteer."<BR><BR>You shake your head and pinch yourself to make sure
you're not dreaming. This was a simple job when you took it - search
the forest for some missing elves. Now you find yourself... somewhere
else, trapped in a massive labyrinth and at the mercy of a trickster
god named Jing. You have dodged traps, solved riddles, and fought
seven-legged spiders just to reach this <u>Welcoming Chamber of Jing</u>
and now the so-called chamber guardian - a floating magical mouth -
wants a <u>volunteer</u>? Wounded and tired, you strain to make sense
of this madness and reach up to scratch your head. You are startled as
the guardian turns to you and smiles. "Excellent!" it says. "You have
raised your hand. We have our volunteer..."</i><BR><BR>Building Block Adventures (BBAs) are
