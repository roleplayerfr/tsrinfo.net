<center>Throughout the civilised lands of man, dwarf and elf, the
practice of necromancy is universally shunned, its knowledge suppressed
and its practitioners persecuted. Only now, with the advent of
Necromancy - Beyond the Grave, are the darkest secrets of this terrible
and frightening magic finally revealed. One skilled in wizardry or
sorcery may use this tome, for good or ill, and tap the powers inherent
beyond death for their own direct benefit. For those willing to risk
the wrath of a society opposed to the art, mastery of necromancy may
bring the most potent of magical energies to command.<BR><BR>Encyclopaedia
Arcane: Necromancy - Beyond the Grave provides Game Masters and players
alike with all the information they need to introduce this macabre form
of magic into their campaigns. The specialist Necromancer now has
access to a huge range of new spells, from the simple animation of small
rodents to the raising of great death hulks from the bottom of the ocean.
He will now be able to manipulate the dark powers present in negative
energy directly, without recourse to simple spellcasting if he is
willing to take the inherent risks. Such a wizard may also discover
the knowledge necessary to begin the transformation into a Lich.<BR><BR>
More paths in the study of Necromancy may also be found - the Spectral
Loremaster who speaks directly with the dead to aid his learning, the
Deathseeker who utilises the rush of negative energy present in death
to power awesome magicks and the hideous Necrophage, and aberration
who grafts the body parts of others onto himself in order to gain their
power.<BR><BR>Will you step beyond the grave?<BR><BR><b>FOR PLAYERS AND
