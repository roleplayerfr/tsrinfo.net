<b>WELCOME TO TULINOS.</b><BR><BR>It is called the city of heroes, for
it was founded by three who answered that description. Great champions
from Tulinos and beyond stand immortalized in marble throughout the city.
Its liberal laws and exuberant nightlife make it a favorite place to
settle after the final battle has been fought and the last treasure
horde has been divided.<BR><BR>It is called the merchant city, for
wealth is the truest measure of a man's worth in Tulinos. Setting at
the mouth of the mighty Hugin River, Tulinos is one of the great
linchpins uniting the continent of Althios. Legions of travelers pass
through its bustling streets every day, bringing wealth and oppurtunities
with them.<BR><BR>It is a city of thieves, and this fact none can deny.
Tulinos is home to the most infamous Thieves Guild in the world. Even
the corrupt government of the city cannot rival the treachery of The
Guild. Everything has a price in Tulinos, and The Guild always gets its
due.<BR><BR><center><b>A Thief's Tale presents a guide to Tulinos, the
city of thieves. It also contains four scenarios tailored to the
subtler adventurer: A Day at the Races, The Big Score, The Duronson
Monster, and Evil Unearthed. A sourcebook for the d20 System.</b><BR><BR>
