<center>A clerics bears arms and a shield in search of adventure, but he is
no mere soldier questing for treasure. He wields spells but he is no mere
enchanter, hungry for knowledge, in service only to himself. The cleric is
a servant of god, the guardian of his faith and spiritual sheperd to the
souls of his congregation. The cleric stands undaunted at the gates of
eternity, wielding mace and magic against the shambling hordes of living
death and the numberless legions of the damned. Once he is beyond the
early stages of his career, the cleric has seen enough and done enough that
his holy ideals will be tempered by the realities of mortal existence.
This makes the cleric an appealing contradiction; a person with unwavering
faith in the glories of the existence beyond that waits for all who
believe, who is also more than familiar enough with the ways in which the
mortals of the living world can hurt and betray one another - and the gods
above - to be a hard-bitten realist.<BR><BR>With the help of this sourcebook,
any character choosing the cleric class will find many alternatives and
options for expanding his range of abilities. With career paths and new
multiclassing options, clerics can customise their advancement with their
chosen branch of training; legendary classes offer an expansion of their
character features that elevate them to epic levels and beyond. Insights
are given into the use of easily overlooked spells, and new magical rules
are introduced in the form of divine ceremony magic and the greater
domains of faith.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</b><BR><BR><table cellpadding="5">
