<center><b>CREATURES OF NIGHTMARE AND LEGEND!</b></center><BR>Heroic
adventurers - not to mention pirates, brigands and ne'er-do-wells - need
monsters to overcome, fiends to thwart, and hostile wildlife to discover.
And nothing enhances a setting like a selection of creatures that were
specifically created for it.<BR><BR><i>Creatures of Freeport</i> is just
that - 96 pages of monsters great and small, and all of them belong in
the <i>Freeport</i> d20 setting like your cutlass belongs in a thieving
knave's vitals. But there's more! As well as the game statistics and
creature descriptions that anyone can put in a monster book, <i>Creatures
of Freeport</i> digs deeper to bring you information you can really
use in your game! Within these pages you will find:<BR><BR><ul><li><b>
Knowledge:</b> What a character knows about a creature from Knowledge
skills, Bardic Knowledge, and other sources of information.<li><b>Uses:</b>
Some creatures are valuable in their own right, and some have parts that
can be used by alchemists, spellcasters and others.<li><b>Adventure Hooks:</b>
Most creature descriptions come with a selection of ideas for using them
in your own adventures.<li><b>Sample NPCs:</b> Some creature descriptions
include ready-to-use NPCs, in the same style as <a href="denfreeport.htm">
<i>Denizens of Freeport</i></a>.<li><b><i>Beastes of ye Farre Landes</i>:</b>
A scholarly tome where characters can research the unique (not to mention
monstrous) flora and fauna of the Serpent's Teeth and their surrounding
waters - if they can get hold of a copy.</ul>One appendix presents some
new animal species, and another covers some of the creatures from this
book and the <a href="../3e/mm35.htm"><i>MM</i></a> that can be
used as companion animals in the <i>Freeport</i> setting - including
several creatures commonly used by aquatic races as pets, guards, and
hunting beasts. All stats in the book are fully <b>3.5</b> compliant.<BR><BR>
From the deceptively familiar malkin to the nightmarish deadwood tree, <i>
Creatures of Freeport</i> has what you need to keep your campaign fresh
and challenging!
