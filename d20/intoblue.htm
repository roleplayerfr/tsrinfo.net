<center><b>THE OCEAN WATERS SURROUND YOU...</b></center><BR>The mighty
seas and oceans are more than just a color on the map. Lurking just below
the surface of those waters are civilizations and dangers that landed folk
can only whisper of in children's fables. Those stories are a reality,
but only true adventurers get to see the stories come to life before
their very eyes.<BR><BR><center><b>ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE FOR PLAYERS & GMS</b></center><BR>
Those that claim to understand the magnificence and power of Nature must
also include the waters of their realm. Survival techniques, terrain
features, the dangers that lurk in the depths, civilizations, and
creatures are just some elements of essential lore that bards, druids,
rangers, and others should grasp.<BR>For the GM, <i><b>Into the Blue</b></i>
allows the waters of a world to churn with as much life as the mountains
of the dwarves or the forests of the elves. Take you adventures to the
next level among the kelp jungles and deepwater trenches of the oceans.<BR><BR>
Requires the use of the <b>Dungeons & Dragons</b> <a href="../3e/phb35.htm"><i>
Player's Handbook</i></a>, published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc. This
product utilizes material from the <b>v3.5</b> revision.<BR><BR><center><b>
