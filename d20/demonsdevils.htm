<b><i>Demons and Devils are among us!</i></b><BR><BR>In the middle of
a blistering winter storm the adventurers struggle up a mountain pass.
The icy wind and freezing sleet make movement difficult. Suddenly
they stop. They walk onto a part of the trail strangely warmed by a
gentle summer's breeze, though behind and around the the terrible storm
rages on. A steaming lily pond lies before them with a dark cave
behind it, from which a seven-foot tall, flame-skinned demon emerges,
licking its yellow fangs with a split, viperlike tongue. The carved
face on the hilt of its sword screams, "Souls master, more souls for
your pleasure!"<BR><BR><b><i>Your campaign just became a lot more
dangerous!</i></b><BR><BR>This 224-page compendium is filled with
demonic and devilish creatures to introduce to your adventuring friends.
Let them discover a hidden evil temple of Gandharva filled with wondrous
magical treasures, but let them be on guard when the demon god Gandharva
actually comes to the prime material plane to punish them for their
insolence. Every demon is more than just stats on a page; each one is
an adventure, a quest awaiting conclusion. Many are, in fact, gods to
whom the evil pray for magical spells.<BR><BR><b><i>Encyclopedia of
Demons and Devils includes:</i></b><BR><BR>172 tanar'ri and baatezu
detailed, using the d20 system with enough color information to drop
them into any fantasy campaign. All of them are drawn from historical
mythologies, from Abraxus and Azazel to depraved Koschei the Deathless
and Asmodeus!<BR><BR>Many demons and devils are worshipped as gods,
presented with enough details to incorporate them into any fantasy
campaign. Characters can become clerics of those evil faiths with all
manner of powers and abilities granted for worshipping those deadly
beings.<BR><BR>Details with spells and costs are presented to allow
your player characters to attempt to summon and control terrible
beings from the Abyss and other outer planes.<BR><BR>Visit <a href="http://www.fastforwardgames.com/">
