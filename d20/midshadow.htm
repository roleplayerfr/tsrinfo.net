The orcs swarm like a plague over half the continent. Mage-hunting legates and
their demonic pets track down the last vestiges of magic in the land. The dark
god Izrador broods and watches the world through his black mirrors. The forces
are overwhelming, your enemies are dark and twisted, and you will surely perish
if you resist.<BR><BR>But you fight.<BR><BR>You are the northborn ancestral
bladebearer. You are the elven spellsoul. You are the pureblood Sarcosan
knight. You are the fellhunting wogren rider. Your magic is rare but ancient,
your allies few but stalwart.<BR><BR>AGAINST THE SHADOW is a player's companion
and DM resource for the dark and epic campaign setting MIDNIGHT. Desperate
fighters against the shadow will find new heroic paths, prestige classes, feats,
spells, and weapons to help them survive. New herbalism rules create a non-magic
party support option specifically tailored for the MIDNIGHT campaign. Finally,
even DMs will find valuable material in new power nexuses and covenant items.<BR><BR>
The dark lord Izrador hasn't won yet. These are bleak times, but there are still
those who pit themselves AGAINST THE SHADOW.<BR><BR><center>Requires the use of
