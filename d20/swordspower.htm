<b><i>With the right sword I can save a kingdom!</i></b><BR><BR>You are
a young knight recently awared honors at Camelot by King Arthur himself.
All the other knights are out on quests and the castle is being stormed
by three terrible Fire Giants. Merlin and Arthur are riding back as
fast as they can, but it's up to you to hold off the giants until help
arrives. Taking up the legendary Sword of Camelot, vast strength flows
through your body and panic is driven from your mind by inspired tactics
and wisdom. Ordering the castle guards to hold their positions, you
mount your war stallion. Riding out of the castle with the enchanted
Sword of Camelot in your hand, you are all there is between the giants
and the walls of the greatest castle in the world.<BR><BR><b><i>This
book delivers the cutting edge!</i></b><BR><BR>This 224-page rulebook
fills a consistent void in fantasy role-playing worlds: too many
magical swords, not enough background to make them interesting. Now the
referee has 105 richly described swords, daggers, and enchanted knives
for his campaign. Each weapon is capable of generating entire campaigns
of action as player characters strive against incredible odds to win
the best blades in the world. No longer non-descript bits of treasure,
these magical swords are masterfully brought to life. Rediscover the
fantasy!<BR><BR><b><i>Swords of Power includes:</i></b><BR><BR>105
enchanted swords, daggers, and knives are detailed using the d20 System
with generous color information to drop them into any fantasy campaign.<BR><BR>
Each blade is listed in two formats. The first format is a creative
story packed with details allowing the referee to get some idea of the
history or interest the blade has created in the world at large. The
second listing at the back of the book provides complete d20 details on
the weapon and often its guardians, pursuers, and other magic protection
surrounding the sword at its present location.<BR><BR>Beautiful illustrations
of every sword, dagger, and knife. Each rendering is an accurate depiction
of the original magical weapon and true to the painstakingly accurate
replicas.<BR><BR><center><i>Swords of Power</i> is a d20 System product
