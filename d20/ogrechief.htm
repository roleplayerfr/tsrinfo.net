<b><i>Avenge a bloody betrayal!</i></b><BR>The vast ogre strongholds
lie well south of human lands. Centuries past, humans thought to keep
the ogres at bay by building a mighty fortress along their frontier, but
they were betrayed and slaughtered in their new keep by ogres who had
tunneled their way in from below. Now the fortress is haunted by dead
human and ogre warriors who protect the most magical treasures anywhere
in the reams of the Green Races.<BR><BR><b><i>A Green Races Adventure!</i></b><BR>
Goblins, trolls, ogres, and their filthy lot are collectively known among
humans as the Green Races. A Green Races adventure takes place far
beyond the protection of walled human cities, their armies and justice,
out in lands where fortunes are made with steel and sorcery!<BR><BR><b>
Fortress of the Ogre Chieftain includes:</b><BR>Four preliminary
encounters, compelling tales prior to the haunted fortress.<BR>Complete
maps and descriptions of the fortress with its many towers and denizens.<BR>
Many new monsters, including spirit and ghost dragons, both goblin and
ogre chieftains and shamans, and several fungi and molds to vex the
adventurous.<BR><BR>Visit <a href="http://www.fastforwardgames.com/">
