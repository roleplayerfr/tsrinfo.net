<center><b>Servants of the Tormentor</b><BR><BR>The dwarven races are quite
diverse, but perhaps the most deviant, both physically and mentally, is the
derro. Though seen as corrupt and malignant by most of their kin, derro perceive
themselves as superior to their brethren. They scoff at their brethren's naïve
notion of blind obedience to kin and kith. For derro, it is power that should
be respected and nothing else. Guided by this precept, the derro follow the
powerful not out of any sense of loyalty toward them but because it is from
them that power can be derived. This lust for power drives derro from birth in
a never-ending struggle for personal glory and honour.<BR><BR>Lurking just
below the surface, derro have been, for most players and Games Masters, an
unseen menace. This Slayer's Guide shall remedy that situation. No longer
shall derro be ignored as a race buried beneath the ground or an adversary
caged in the caverns of the hidden world below. The sun can not keep the
derro from what is rightfully theirs forever.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</b><BR><BR>
