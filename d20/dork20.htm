<center><b>"It must be mine!"</b></center><BR><b>O</b>nce again, your
character finds himself lying at the bottom of the Pit of Eternal Doom,
waiting for the approaching Turbonium Dragon to munch on his tasty carcass.
What do you do?<BR><BR>a) Beg the mighty beast not to use you bones as
toothpicks.<BR><BR>b) Trust the kindly GM to bail you out.<BR><BR>c) Spring
your "Oh, the Humanity!" card on the dragon to keep him from saving against
your <i>cause fear</i> spell. Then, when it has fled before your
magnificent buffness, use your handy "Huzzah!" card to take 20 leaping out
of the pit!<BR><BR>Atlas Games comes to the rescue with the Dork20 Deck -
56 full-color cards illustrated by award-winning cartoonist John Kovalic!
Dork20 Deck cards modify the standard d20 System rules, allowing
characters to perform nigh-impossible deeds that turn your adventures into
legend, and your game sessions into hilarious fun! The Dork20 Deck can
be used with any d20 System roleplaying game.<BR><BR><center><b>Requires
