<center><b>WALK THE MEAN STREETS</b></center><BR>Famous as much for its brutality
as for its size and wide variety of citizenry, the City State of the Invincible
Overlord beckons to adventurers throughout the land. Can your PCs survive the
mean streets of an evil city built upon the backs of the conquered? To negotiate
their way safely through its labyrinthine roads, laws, and customs, your PCs had
better keep their wits - and their blades - sharp!<BR><BR><center><b>DUNGEONS AND
DARKNESS</b></center><BR>Yet more challenges await adventurers beneath the city
streets. Are your PCs ready for the various conspiracies, dungeons, tunnels,
and creatures that lie under the City State... or, like so many before them, will
they simply donate their wealth and bones to another's cause?<BR><BR>Far more
than just a revision, this Judges Guild classic is updated and re-imagined for
v.3.5 rules. It contains a wealth of information on both the popular City State
of the Invincible Overlord and on the dungeons and creatures first described in
the original Wraith Overlord.<BR><BR><center><i>Requires the use of the Dungeons
& Dragons <a href="../3e/phb35.htm">Player's Handbook</a>, published
by Wizards of the Coast.<BR>This product utilizes updated material from the
v.3.5 revision.</i><BR><BR>FANTASY - SWORDS AND SORCERY<BR>ADVENTURE (CITY &
