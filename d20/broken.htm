Throughout the summer months, orc warbands have been striking out of
the Broken Plain across the Nonddharya River, raiding human settlements
all along the frontier. For weeks, as you have traveled throughout the
North, the seemingly endless hordes of orcs are all anyone talks about.
Farmers fear for their crops and livestock, villagers fear for their
families and homes, and soldiers fear for their lives.<BR><BR>One band
in particular, the Bloody Hatchet tribe, has become infamous throughout
the region. The tribe's warchief, Rexas, is reputedly an orc-ogre
halfbreed and a fearsome opponent on the battlefield. Local legend has
it that Rexar has sacked more than a dozen villages, specifically
targeting churches and shrines and stealing their sacred icons before
burning them to the ground.<BR><BR>Now, the word is out that orcs have
been spotted in the forests near Goodland, a small village on the
Nonddharya River. Lord Reisling, the frontier baron whose responsibility
it is to protect Goodland, is reportedly offering bounties and rewards
to anyone who can turn back the orcs and protect the village.<BR><BR>
There have been sightings of Rexar's bloody banner in the area. Can you
stop the orog warrior from raising it over the burning ruins of
Goodland?
