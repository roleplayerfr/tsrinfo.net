Level Characters</b><BR><BR>The Teeth of the Moon Sow are legendary weirdstones,
said to have been created by the Goddess herself from the ten greatest bards of
Tir Nan Og and beyond. Any one of them would be an artefact of enormous power,
but it is said that a tribe which rebuilt the complete circle could rule the Land
of the Young if it wished. You have another pressing concern, which is that
your own tribe's king is a merciless tyrant who already has too much magical
power for your liking. Given a chance to finally depose Osdann, as well as
acquire a Tooth of the Moon Sow or two for your tribe, it is surely well worth
tangling with the drune lords and their servants. But what of the warband of
skyclad warriors, and what of the Half-Dead?<BR><BR>The second part of the epic
Horned Lord and Moon Sow campaign for <a href="slaine.htm">Slaine:
The Roleplaying Game of Celtic Heroes</a>, the Teeth of the Moon Sow continues
the quest to rebuild the ancient stone circle, depose the tyrannical King
Osdann, and prevent Ragnarok!<BR><BR>Requires the use of the Dungeons & Dragons
