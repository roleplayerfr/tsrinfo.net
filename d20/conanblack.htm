<center>GIANT BLACK MEN SQUAT IN THE DOORWAY OF THEIR THATCHED HUTS, OR
LOLL ON GROUND IN THEIR SHADE. THEIR WOMEN MOVE UP AND DOWN THE STREETS,
WATER-GOURDS OR BASKETS OF FOOD ON THEIR HEADS. CHILDREN PLAY OR FIGHT IN
THE DUST, WHILE IN THE SQUARES THE BLACK FOLK CHAFFER AND BARGAIN OVER
PLANTAINS, BEER AND HAMMERED BRASS ORNAMENTS. SMITHS CROUCH OVER TINY

DOWN ON ALL, THE SWEAT, MIRTH AND ANGER OF THE BLACK PEOPLE.<BR><BR>Of
the numerous adventures faced by Conan, his exploits in the many lands of
the Black Kingdoms are easily amongst the most tantalising and
tempestuous of the various tales. Now, this trilogy of adventures gives
other Hyborian adventurers a chance to experience the dangers and wonders
of the Black Kingdom.<BR><BR>Tales of the Black Kingdoms comprises three
scenarios designed for five to six party members of between 3rd and 4th
level. Each scenario can be run as either an individual adventure, or
combined together as a complete campaign, in which characters become
embroiled in a Wadai revolt, discover the mysteries of Atlaia and battle
the savage cultists of Jullah. Tales of the Black Kingdoms details the
journey of a group of stalwart adventurers, their triumphs and losses,
bloody betrayal and unexpected twists as alliances are formed and broken
in the mysterious savage lands of souther Hyboria.<BR><BR>Each scenario
includes a detailed description of the lands in which the adventure takes
place as well as a menagerie of native creatures that scour the plains
and jungles in search of fresh meat.<BR><BR>Tales of the Black Kingdoms
reflects the narrative nature of the Conan tales, with each scenario
built around a series of bloody or mysterious events ensuring that your
own Tales of the Black Kingdoms feel as if they flow right out of the
pages of your very own Conan chronicle.<BR><BR>Read on and discover the
intrigue, brutality and dark magic of the savage south!</center>
