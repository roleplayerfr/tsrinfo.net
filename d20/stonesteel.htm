From the dawn of history, mankind has made war. In every age and civilization,

<center>No longer.</center><BR>'From Stone to Steel' is a book of weaponry and
armor, but it is also an examination of history and culture. From age to age,
every culture has approached similar ends with its own unique perspective.
'From Stone to Steel' is not merely a simple list of items, but rather an
explanation of their use, their cultural significance, even their drawbacks.
Besides weapons and armor, 'From Stone to Steel' contains new feats, new skills,
new prestige classes, and new game mechanics. Through each chapter, topics

world. You'll even find items of myth, fantastic construction materials, new
spells to augment weapons and armor, and even fantasy racial items (based,
where possible, on myth or legend).<BR><BR>From stone-age primitives to the
height of the Renaissance, history is in your hands. 'From Stone to Steel' -
Never look at d20 gaming the same way again!
