<i>The seas are a realm of unique woner, singular beauty, and uncompromising
danger. They house a vastness of life undreamed of by those who must draw
airy breath. Indescribable visions and encounters beyond expression await
beneath the waves. Here the benign wisdom of the sagacious B'Thum Bala
parallels the heartless naltchea's cruel exploitations. Here the allure of
a dazzling reef conceals the horrendous predations of a lurking skreit.
Here the enchanting song of the sea piper gives way to the chilling dirge
of the Devourer of All. Beauty dwells here, but so too does death.<BR><BR>
-Olin Drammerstad<BR><BR>Second in the series of indispensable guidebooks
produced by the legendary Wanderers Guild, this tome is an exciting
anthology of essays and observations collected by Olin Drammerstad, famed
treasure seeker and gentleman of the sea, and the late Vilg Kepnear,
respected scholar and researcher of marine life. The knowledge and accounts
of these partners, earned through nearly sixty combined years of
exploration and adventure, provide fascinating and insightful reading.<BR><BR>
Dozens of previously undocumented creatures are given generous space for
detailed explanation and splendid artistic depiction. Additional entries
examine equally important topics such as the expertise of the Sea Delvers,
their specialized trappings, and the fantastic environment beneath the
waves.<BR><BR>Scribed for the Guild by eminent quillwielder Gunnar
Hultgren and designed and illustrated by renowned illuminator Andy Hopp,
this d20 monster manual continues the Wanderers Guild legacy in a volume
designed to arm the traveler of the seas against the dangers and mysteries
of the boundless blue.
