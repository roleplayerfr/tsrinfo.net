In the late hours, heroes find themselves quaffing a good drink, eating
a hot meal, and reciting great tales of their bold deeds... this is the
life that the true adventurer cherishes.<BR><BR>But, when this precious
time is cut short by the thunderous bellow of a dragon - one that is
hungry for power and thirsty for an unattainable treasure - the true
adventurer does not argue.<BR><BR>And when that treasure lies in the
heart of a cave where an even more powerful source resides - one that
guards the very power that is sought - the true adventurer does not
flinch.<BR><BR>And when the treasure bears a power beyond thought, so
great that a line of dragons have sworn to defend it - even to the
death - the true adventurer asks, when do we leave?<BR><BR>The Legacy
of Madness is more than just a myth. For some, it is a way of life.
