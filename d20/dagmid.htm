Today started just like any other day in the city. For once, it's nice
to wake up in the comfortable arms of civilization rather than the
pitch-black depths of some musty dungeon. The bustle of the crowds, the
sun on your face, and the energy of the city all soothe your nerves and
help push out of your mind the terrors and dangers of your many adventures.<BR><BR>
As you make your way down the street, a ragged urchin runs up to you,
clutching a piece of parchment in one hand.<BR><BR>"Hello there, you,"
he says, pointing at a member of your party. "A man gave me four silver
to deliver this to you. He said you'd give me four more on delivery."
He presses the parchment into your hand, eyeing your coin pouch as he
waits expectantly for his payment.<BR><BR>The parchment reads: "I'm
surprised you'd show up around here again, Madarius. If you keep
flaunting your face around town, it's only a matter of time before Krell
or Cassatta decides to smash it in. Gods, I'd have half a mind to do
that myself if we didn't make such a good team. I'm willing to forgive
your last double cross if you see fit to meet me in the alley behind the
Blue Ox just before sundown today."<BR><BR>Madarius? Cassatta? Krell?<BR><BR>
It looks like adventure has found you, rather than waiting for you to
come to it.
