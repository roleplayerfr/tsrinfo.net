Through acrid mists and bitter waters they march. They are quiet,
making no sound as they leave the marshlands. Spears held high, the
warriors scan the fog for signs of the attacker.<BR><BR>Every step took
them further from their old lands.<BR><BR>Every step brings them closer
to the lands of their 'allies,' who had abandoned them when the marsh
turned black and foul.<BR><BR>Every step brings one of them down to the
befouled earth beneath the water, there to rest forever.<BR><BR>Every
step churns up more of the poisoned water as it seeps between their
scales and below their skin.<BR><BR>So many had already died on this
march, and after the attack, they had so few left...<BR><BR>The mists
part in the night. The village's light bathes them in a false welcome.
The human guards are unsteady, either from poison or from drink. The
town celebrates the end of the trade season, but not a man raises a
toast to the creatures that died for it.<BR><BR>So many had died from
the first attack of the beast and from the aftermath, but the humans
would suffer for such treachery...
