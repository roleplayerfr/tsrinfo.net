<center><b>DANGER * EXPLORATION * ADVENTURE</b><BR><BR><i>I'm sure the mountains
doesn't pose much of a threat at all. There's nothing out there aside from a
few clans of barbarian dwarves, the odd goblin tribe, and a few rogue earth
spirits. Little danger to those such as you who wear stour armor, carry sharp
swords, and wield mighty spells. Of course, you might accidentally stumble
into a patch of fire vines and be forced to take off your armor when your skin
breaks out in festering blisters. The goblins are little match in a stand-up
fight, but if they drop boulders on you like they usually do those swords will
only weight you down as you try to run away. As for your spells, a blast of
fire might singe the dwarf berserkers, but the explosion is liable to bring
half the mountain down on your head.<BR><BR>As I said, you shouldn't have much
to fear. The dwarves are fools who gladly throw themselves on spears and lances,
the goblins are poorly trained and flee at the first sign of danger, and the
earth spirits are no match for your spells.</center><BR></i>-Olaf Stonestrider,
Ranger of the Peaks<BR><BR><center><b>GO BEYOND THE DUNGEON<BR><BR>This
sourcebook expands the venues of adventure, presenting an array of hostile
environments for your wilderness campaigns. From the tundra's deadly cold to
the desert's searing heat, the wilderness offers dangers and threats that make
an angry ogre or hungry troll look like a pushover. With the rules and advice
outlined here, DMs can design adventures that emphasize the environment's
daunting challenges and strange, wondrous realms.<BR><BR>Leave the dungeon
