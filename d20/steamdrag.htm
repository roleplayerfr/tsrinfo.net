A hundred years ago the steam dragon Glorack made her home within the
Fallow glacier, not far from the village of Trommel. She emerged from
her lair to pillage the countryside, scalding peasants, roasting knights
within their own armor, and rending countless brave souls with her
talons. Glorack hoarded gold from dwarven holds, elven jewelry, gnomish
magical items, and coin from many unfortunate nobles.<BR><BR>Finally an
intrepid band of heroes penetrated her ice caves to destroy her. When
they inflicted a seemingly mortal blow on Glorack, the dragon's carcass
and her treasure melted deep into the ice in the scorching steam and
blood that poured from her body. The steam dragon was vanquished.<BR><BR>
For a century the lands near the Fallow Range glacier fields enjoyed
freedom from Glorack's tyranny. Now Glorack has returned!<BR><BR>The
villagers of Trommel fear that the dreaded steam dragon has somehow
risen from emtombment within the deep ice of the Fallow glacier . Scouts
report signs that a dragon has moved back into the icy wastelands.<BR><BR>
Trommel's elders have already sponsored several expeditions to destroy
the steam dragon, but none have returned. Brave youngsters from the
village and experienced adventurers from lands afar climbed into the
glacier and assaulted the steam dragon's lair. If they weren't cooked
alive by Glorack's scalding breath, they probably froze to death trapped
in an icy crevasse or a frigid underground lake. Nobody ever discovered
their remains or stories of their true demise.<BR><BR>The village elders
offer to equip adventurers heading into the Fallow Range, seeking the
glacier and the small cave at its base. Although they can grant no
reward for slaying the steam dragon, they relinquish all rights to
Glorack's treasure to anyone who destroys her before she rises from her
icy lair to terrorize the countryside.
