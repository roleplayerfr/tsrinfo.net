<center><b>Kick Monster Butt</b><BR><BR>You're looking at the first
strategy guide for the<BR>revised edition of the world's most popular role
playing game.<BR>Let's be real - the game's about combat, not charisma!<BR>
This strategy guide gives you the strategies and techniques you need to
win.<BR>It's like a football coach's playbook, or a video game champion's
cheat codes.<BR>Feat combos, sneaky skill uses, multiclassing secrets,
and abusing the rules:<BR>that's what it's all about.<BR><BR><b>Build the
Perfect Warrior</b><BR><BR>Pick the wrong feats and you'll be pushing up
daisies.<BR>Pick the right ones and you'll be racking up XP! This book
is all about making the right<BR>decisions to build the perfect warrior.
Whether you're a fighter, ranger, paladin, monk,<BR>or barbarian, if you're
interested in combat, you'll learn how to max out your abilities.<BR><BR><b>
Make the Right Decision</b><BR><BR>Who has the better chance of hitting
an AC 15 target: a 5th level fighter with a<BR>two-handed longsword, or a
5th level ranger with a longsword and a shortsword?<BR>If your BAB is +7
and you're facing an AC 15 monster,<BR>how much of your attack bonus should
you allocate to Power Attack?<BR>Does fighting defensively really help you
live longer?<BR>When you're through with this book, you'll know the
answers.<BR><BR><b>But Don't Tell the DM</b><BR><BR>Everything in this
guide comes straight from the core rulebooks.<BR>It's 100% official
material; all we do is tell you how to use it.<BR>But you don't want your
DM to read this book.<BR>Just think, all these useful tips and suggestions
in<BR>the hands of the guy who runs the monsters!<BR>Shudder. Keep this
one tucked away<BR>or you'll regret it.<BR><BR>Requires the use of the
Dungeons & Dragons,<BR>Third Edition Core Books, published<BR>by Wizards
of the Coast, Inc.<BR>This product utilizes updated<BR>material from the<BR>
v.3.5 revision.</center></td></tr><tr><td><BR></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#FFDDAA">
