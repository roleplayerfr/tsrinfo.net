The wizened sage shuffles through some yellowed papers on the desk of
his cluttered study.<BR><BR>"As you probably know, Froderick the
Uncanny, master thief and arch-mage, died 150 years ago. In life, he
was a consummate rogue and avid game player. As Froderick neared the
end of his days, he built an unknown number of tombs in which his
remains and most valued possessions might be interred. Two so far have
been discovered, but tales tell of as many as a dozen. Froderick's
remains and full wealth have never been found.<BR><BR>"Recently, I
discovered excerpts from Froderick's diaries in a treatise written by
an imperial architect on magical construction techniques. Based on
these fragments, I have been able to discern the location of another of
Froderick's tombs.<BR><BR>"As you can well imagine, I am extremely
interested in learning the secrets of this lost tomb. I am willing to
pay you 500 gp for a map of the tomb. In addition, I am offering 50 gp
to each of you who agrees to grant me an interview after your exploration
of the complex. You, of course, can keep any treasure you find in the
tomb.<BR><BR>"Now, I must warn you, this excursion is likely to be
perilous. Froderick was a master architect who favored both magical
and mechanical traps, as well as summoned and bound guardians. You
must be alert, cautious, and skillful if you are to succeed."
