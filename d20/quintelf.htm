<center>Living for an eternity, elves are free spirits of nature made
flesh, revelling in their connection with all things magical and
proud of the power flowing in their blood. The unseen voice echoing
among the trees with a promise of swift death to any intruder, the
master shaper who asks nature to co-operate in the building of
fantastical dwellings, the warrior who charges into the field atop a
flying beast, the child whose soul is still strong with the power of
the fey, the renegade who worships dark deities deep below the ground,
the artist who keeps magic and tradition alive through song and dance,
the wizard who bends magic to his will by the power of his ancient
blood. All of these are a few examples of elves, the most traditional
and vivid of all fantasy races. The Quintessential Elf is a sourcebook
that will greatly expand the options available for elf characters
regardless of the class they belong to, giving elements to flesh them
out as unique being beyond a few racial bonuses.<BR><BR><center><b>Inside
