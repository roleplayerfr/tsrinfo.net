Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
The legendary city of Freeport is a seedy port town there former pirates
settle down to become "businessmen" while street gangs fight over the
slave trade. In the deepest warrens of this already dangerous place,
mad cultists worship unspeakable gods - and sometimes these sinister deeds
bubble to the surface. There's a dark shadow over Freeport today, as
yet another innocent child has gone missing. The trail leads to the old
Cresh Manor, boarded up but not forgotten. The city needs heroes to
find these missing children. But are the heroes brave enough to conquer
the dark shadows of Freeport?
<BR><BR>If you enjoy this adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl
Classics series!
