<center><i>Ultimate Prestige Classes, Volume 1</i> is the first volume of the
Ultimate series, compiling some of the best prestige classes available. Designed
to be seamlessly slotted into any fantasy-based D20 games system, these
sourcebooks offer the best of the best that have appeared in terms of rules and
options for fantasy d20 games, as well as new material that can both be easily
included into any campaign. Players and Games Masters will find a wealth of
options to enrich their characters and antagonists.<BR><BR>Way of the Warrior
explores classes whose focus is fighting, pure and simple. Even if enhanced by
magic or other abilities, combat is what moves and motivates these characters.
Secrets of the Arvane features a plethora of wizard and sorcerer variants, new
areas of magic and sources of arcane power. The Power of Faith is devoted to
those classes that draw power from the commitment they have with an external
power, be it a deity, an idea or a natural force. By Wits and Skill is a collection
of classes that rely on extraordinary abilities, on their savvy and general
know-how to get them out of trouble or carry them to success. Mind Over Matter
explores the power of psionics and the mysteries surrounding those talented
with the power of the mind. Finally Monstrous Paths gives players and Games
Masters a look at how some monster races can give those pesky adventurers a
nasty surprise.</center>
