pyres burned day and night, choking the air with ash and blotting out the sun as
the undead legion of Gar'Udok advanced across the Northern lands. The great
necromancer spurned all that is holy in his quest for personal power, and his
contempt for the living was only exceeded by his greed and taste for destruction.
Thanks to the concerted efforts of allied nations, he was defeated, but his
legacy "lives" on as his most powerful artifacts are unearthed and his surviving
minions rise again.<BR><BR>From the award-winning team at Ambient Inc. comes
this book of necromantic goodies suitable for inclusion in any fantasy d20 game.
