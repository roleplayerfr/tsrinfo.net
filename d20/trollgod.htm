<b><i>The Troll God Awakens!</i></b><BR>Troll priests are feared among
all the Green Races; all of their dark rituals involve living sacrifices
to unnamed, hideous gods. Could there be something more afoot at their
temple to Afnar, their black-hearted god of vengeance? Soldiers are
gathering in its swampy enclave, and strange elves and dragons come and
go in the misty twilight. Troll pilgrims bearing chests of gold and
gems arrive and never leave. Does the troll god stir?<BR><BR><b><i>A
Green Races Adventure!</i></b><BR>
Goblins, trolls, ogres, and their filthy lot are collectively known among
humans as the Green Races. A Green Races adventure takes place far
beyond the protection of walled human cities, their armies and justice,
out in lands where fortunes are made with steel and sorcery!<BR><BR>
<b><i>Temple of the Troll God</i> includes:</b><BR>Preliminary encounters
along the dangerous road through wild lands to the mysterious troll
temple.<BR>Complete maps and descriptions of the temple and its swampy
hiding place.<BR>Many new monsters, including half-fiend trolls and
fiendish trolls, and the troll god itself, Afnar, a creature of the
outer planes that has its sights set on this world.<BR><BR>
