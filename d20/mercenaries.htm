<center><b>GOLD * GUTS * GREED</b><BR><BR><i>Before the war between
East Unger and The Empire of Besuhl, most mercenaries lived off the
land, fighting in taverns or doing whatever it took to survive. It
got so bad at one point, some companies resorted to banditry... they
hired themselves out to take care of the "problem" they'd created.<BR>
Those that were caught were hanged.<BR><BR>I would never say war is
good.<BR>But it's good for my coin curse and it's good for the kingdom.
And while we're killing men willing to die for their beliefs, I'm just
glad I'm not the one doing the dying.</i></center><BR>-Olad Whitebeard<BR><BR>
<center><b>THIS IS THE KEY TO SURVIVAL<BR><BR>Money is the only goal
worth dying for; mercenaries know this, and have learned profit from
their wisdom. This sourcebook is the perfect resource for playing
mercenaries and running mercenary campaigns. Inside these 256 pages
you'll find new races, classes, feats, and magic - everything DMs and
players need for endless adventuring oppurtunities.<BR><BR>The time
for heroes is over. Pay up.<BR><BR>ANY DEED, ANY PRICE</b></center><BR>
