<center>Nobody needs to have prestige classes explained to him or her
any more. The question has now become 'which one should I have?' rather
than 'how exactly does this work?' Professional game designers and
individual gamers alike have been working hard to realise their visions,
whether they involved the creation of a class they have always wanted to
play but have never been able to find, or the building of a non-player
character whose abilities had to be just right.<BR><BR><i>Ultimate Prestige
Classes, Volume II</i> is our second serving of prestige classes, compiled
from quality sources and carefully selected for detail, rules consistency,
playability and originality. These sourcebooks are designed to be slotted
seamlessly into any fantasy-based d20 games system and offer the best of
the best that have appeared in terms of rules and options for fantasy d20
games, as well as new material than can both be easily included into any
campaign. Players and Games Masters will find a wealth of options to
enrich their characters and antagonists.<BR><BR>Requires the use of the
