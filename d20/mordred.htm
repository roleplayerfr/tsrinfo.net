<b>U<i>neasy rests the crown on the head of the king...<BR><BR></i>
I<i></b>n Ancient England, a tyrant king holds the land in the grip of
fear. With the might of a magical sword and the threatened return of
a long-dead sorcerer, this fiend holds the noble, the good, and the
true in his sway, squelching the will of the people and denying the
claim of the rightful heir to the throne. The villain's name is
Arthur.<BR><BR>Return to a world you only think you know. <b>I, MORDRED</b>
returns to the original legends of King Arthur as a mad dictator,
clinging to power through use of his enforcers, the Knights of the
Round Table. His son, Mordred, is the rightful heir and struggles to
amass an army in the name of justice to usurp his father's throne. And
in the background, Arthur's wicked half-sister, Morgan le Fey, schemes
to control England's ultimate destiny. This is a land crumbling in
decay, desperately in search of heroes.</i>
