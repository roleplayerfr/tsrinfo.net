<center>PLACES TO GO. PEOPLE TO SEE.</center><BR><i>Backdrops</i>
presents a collection of ready-to-use locations for your D20 System
fantasy campaign. Each location, or "set" is detailed in a two-page
spread including a scale map and descriptive text to enrich your
adventures, wherever they take place. <i>Backdrops</i> is like paying
a set designer to build a few stock sets on your campaign's back lot!<BR><BR>
<i>Backdrops</i> features fourteen set scenes, including:<BR><BR>The
bath house is a place of whispers, threats, lies, and scheming. Beneath
its tranquility it is a tense scene, where enemies face each other
without swords or shields.<BR><BR>An urban stable breeds noble horses
in which the wisdom of ancient tribal kings is scattered as a blessed
reincarnation.<BR><BR>In the secret smithy, three burning golden dwarves
arrive from within the forge at the stroke of midnight to craft wondrous
items.<BR><BR>Small, fortified caracanserai offer protection and company
to travelers and traders ... though bandits know that the most valuable
thing in any caravanserai is the caravan visiting it.<BR><BR>Narrow
alleyways wind like veins through the city ... but only three sorts of
souls walk these streets at night: lantern-bearing guards, cutthroats,
and the undead.<BR><BR>In the thick of the city are the public cages
where burglars, cutpurses, housebreakers, and felons are jailed; those
souls who cannot pay their fine in coin will pay it with time.<BR><BR>
Link the sets to detail a single city, or scatter them across your
campaign world. Use them as a foundation for more exotic travails for
your PCs, or to fill in the dark corners of your characters' hometown.
It's your game, after all. <i>Backdrops</i> just give you more time
to play it!<BR><BR><center>Requires the use of the Dungeons & Dragons
