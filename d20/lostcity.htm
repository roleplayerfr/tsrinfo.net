<center><b>A Low Level Mini-Campaign For the Revised Rules</b></center><BR>
An epic introductory location-based adventure for character levels 1-5,
revised for the new rules system, this huge mini-campaign provides months
of gaming material. Players can attempt to stop the city beggars from
being sold as slaves, face bandits in the wilderness, expose the
corruption of a noble family, destroy an ancient evil, and explore
mysterious caves containing the remnants of a ruined civilization. This
adventure is the perfect way to begin a new campaign under the revised
version of the Third Edition Rules!<BR><BR><center><b>Adventure on the
Borderlands!</b></center><BR>The book details a complete city, the
wilderness surrounding it, and a huge, 5-level dungeon from a
long-forgotten civilization. Dozens of minor quests and puzzles are
used to distract and entertain adventurers while the main storyline builds
to a crescendo. This adventure and sourcebook contains over 30 highly
detailed side quests that take place in the wilderness and city, and the
dungeon itself contains over 200 numbered encounter areas.<BR><BR><center>
