<center><b>A monstrous world that thrives on treachery and greed!<BR><BR>
Monsters prey upon monsters where humans, elves, and dwarves fear to
tread!</b></center><BR><ul><li>Player characters begin as common
soldiers and plunderers in the ranks of the monstrous armies. Whether
bugbear, orc, or kobold, they all crave treasure and power, and what
better place to take it than from their monstrous neighbors! Factions
launch assaults against dungeons and lairs to throw out their denizens
and make them their own!</ul><ul><li>For the players, every Green Races
faction has a new prestige class! That's 15 new prestige classes in
all! Become an orc Bone Shaker, one of their mysterious witch doctors,
or create a Soulwalker, a reverent troll spiritualist. Beware the
ogre Beskars, whose unexpectedly sophisticated manner hides deadly
subterfuge!</ul><ul><li>Characters advance through the ranks of their
Green Races faction as the campaign progresses. Eventually they climb
to positions of power, even leading the 'hundreds,' units of troops
sent on missions against distant lairs or enemy armies. In time,
a character can advance to lead an entire faction, becoming warlord
over an entire species of monster!</ul><ul><li>The lands of the Green
Races teem with other creatures aligned with none of them. Fire and
stone giants live in the mountains, and the swampfolk pretty much keep
to themselves. Azazel, a powerful devil, presides over a horde in the
deep deserts. Meet all of these and more in the lands of the Green
Races!</ul><ul><li>Monsters crave dungeons. They want only to occupy
them, and nothing boils their green blood more than a dungeon crawling
with other monsters. Every Green Races faction has a complete dungeon,
ruin, cavern or lair. The characters must protect their own, but all
others are potential targets of an expanding empire! Additional
unowned ruins tempt all the races - they must be siezed!</ul><center>
