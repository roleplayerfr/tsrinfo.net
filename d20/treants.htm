What happens when a forest dies? Its treant swears vengeance. Learn about the
dark side of treants: fury, hatred, revenge, and the charred, undead creatures
left behind when a treant burns...<BR><BR>The Complete Guide to Treants is a
stand-alone, world-neutral sourcebook covering everything you ever wanted to
know about treants. It includes:<BR><BR><ul><li>Detailed background material
on treants, including their various groves, the guild-like branches of the
Vine of Tales, their cosmology, the deep treants of the underdark, and more.<li>
Stats and background on the dark side of treants: shadowed treants, who resort
to great evils to protect their trees; forsaken treants, driven insane by the
loss of their forest; the blasted, treants killed with fire then animated to
walk again as undead; and more.<li>Full stats for treants as a character race,
including four new prestige classes: Treeherd, Woodwarden, Firesworn, and
Leafsinger.</ul>The Complete Guide to Treants is the sixth volume in the
Complete Guide series. Each volume is a complete guide to playing a given kind
of monster. As a GM, you'll learn how to run that monster - both in combat and
role-playing situations. And since every Complete Guide includes guidelines on
playing the monster as a character race, players have new options, too.
