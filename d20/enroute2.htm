<center><b><i>The Journey There Is Half the Battle</i></b></center><BR>The
road to adventure is never an easy one. Whether travelling on horseback
through lonely forest wildernesses, with a caravan across rolling plains, or
by stalwart ship, danger awaits in the form of escaped slaves, imprisoned
mermaids, swarming elementals, blink bunnies, insane inventors, peeved
trolls, possessed livestock, and a bevy of other hazards to block your
way.<BR><BR>Like the original <a href="enroute.htm"><i>En
Route</i></a>, the <i>En Route II</i> collection presents short encounters
that GMs can easily insert into longer adventures of their own design, or
use as transitions between published modules. <i>En Route II</i> features
scenarios suitable to sea voyages and to land-bound travel, which can be
played in about one hour's time.<BR><BR>The <i>En Route II</i> encounter
sourcebook includes:<BR><BR><ul><li>Fourteen unique encounters designed to
be played at a moment's notice.</ul><ul><li>New magic items like the
<i>saddle of the sea steed</i> and the <i>fiendish logbook</i>, new creatures
like the flying fierce and blood vessel, and a cast of full-stated NPCs
ready to use straight out of the book.</ul><ul><li>Quick-reference
appendices arranged by new D20 material, encounter locations, and Encounter
Level, to make finding encounters and crunchy bits fast and easy.<BR><BR><center>
