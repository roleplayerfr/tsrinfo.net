<center>Fools share many traits with bards but their aims are often entirely
at odds. Bards are the centre of attention, with their performances inspiring
courage and admiration for the performer and his audiences. In contrast, the
skilled display of fools may entertain but the fool is never the point of the
performance. Instead, the subject of a fool's efforts is rarely as grateful
as all his faults are laid bare for the world to see. Kind-hearted fools do
this to teach, in the hope of their artistic victims learning from the display.
There are also bitter fools, lost in the cynicism, whose aims are to humiliate
and bring down those above them. An evil fool can be a viscious, cutting
performer, making his audiences laugh even while he sows derision and hatred
in their hearts.<BR><BR>
This is the twelth book of the Power Classes
series from Mongoose publishing. Designed to be seamlessly slotted into any fantasy-based d20
system game, each of these mini-supplements introduces an entirely new core
character class, adding a whole new dimension to campaigns. Players will find
full details on how to use the new character class, greatly increasing the
wealth of options they are presented with by the core rulebooks while Games
Masters may revel in the wide variety of new classes they have at their
disposal for non-player characters in their campaigns. Each Power Class
booklet can provide hours of gaming enjoyment at an all-new low cost.<BR><BR><b>
