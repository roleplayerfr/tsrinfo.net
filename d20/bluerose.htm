the Blue Rose, shines as a new light following the dark age of the Sorcerer
Kings. Now, envoys of the Sovereign's Finest strive to protect Aldis from
threats like the Lich Kingdom of Kern and the fanatical Theocracy of Jarzon,
as well as monsters and dark magic left over from the Shadow Wars of the
Sorcerer Kings. Aided by the rhydan - their psychic animal companions - the
champions of the Blue Rose guard the Light against the power of the Shadow.<BR><BR>
