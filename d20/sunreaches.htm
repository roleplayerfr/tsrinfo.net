Welcome to the Red Planet!</b></center><BR>Sundered Reaches details a new
fantasy campaign setting filled with the most deadly challenges and sinister
mysteries ever. Even the tiniest of monsters may be more powerful than the
toughest player character! 5,000-year-old mysteries dot the withered landscape!

defenses, stand ready to be plundered - if the characters can survive long
enough!<BR><BR><center><b>The toughest challenges you can imagine!</b></center><BR>
You hold in your hands a tremendous resource designed for powerful campaigns.

settings will struggle to merely survive. A world where even natives, hailing
from one of the new and unique races that call Mars home, must fight the
elements and their enemies to forge a life. Explore the strange floating canal
cities, try to reach the depths of toxic scarlet forests, or struggle to bring
peace to this dying world. The choices are yours! But be warned, players and
GMs looking for an easy adventure need not open this book...<BR><BR>Visit

breaks new ground in high-level fantasy gaming. This unique d20 campaign
setting presents the perfect challenge for players who have been there and
done that. Characters can be drawn to the Red Planet from any other d20
campaign or created anew. Sometimes newly arrived characters walk unchanged
onto the Red Planet, but just as often they are reshaped into entirely new
life forms. Every Martian mile presents its own new and deadly encounters! The
creatures that walk the Red Planet are fierce and every corner of the planet is
shrouded in mystery. GMs and players alike will have the time of their lives
exploring and shaping this new world!<BR><BR><b>About the Authors:</b><BR><BR>
