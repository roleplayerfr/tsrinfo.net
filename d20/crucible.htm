<center><b>Shadows and Light</b></center><BR>The trees part before you,
revealing the crumbling walls of the ruined keep. Only hours ago, you
set off after the marauding orc band responsible for the destruction of
the temple of Freya and the theft of its sacred crucible. But something
else waits for you within the ruined walls. Something darker and far
more sinister. Something that has hidden from the light for ages.<BR><BR><center><b>
A Hero's Quest</b></center><BR>The first in a new series of D20
adventures by Necromancer Games, <b>The Crucible of Freya</b> is a
challenging introductory adventure for any fantasy campaign. Detailing
the village of Fairhill, the surrounding wilderness and a nearly ruined
keep, as well as the dungeon levels beneath, this adventure module
provides all the material a DM needs to start his or her new Third
Edition campaign. Will your characters learn what dark forces are
behind the orc raids?
