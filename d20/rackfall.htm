<center><b>Alistene Krineweld has disappeared.</b></center>The authorities
of the city of Ragmoran have arrested her husband for her murder, even
though he maintains she was kidnapped. For Benesh Krineweld is both a
moneylender and an elf, and for a man with as many enemies as he has,
there is no justice.<BR><BR>Unless a group of adventurers can be found
to do what no one else is willing to do - brave the ruins at the source
of Rackfall River, rescue Alistene from her kidnappers, and probe
Benesh's innocence - he will be executed for a murder he did not commit.<BR><BR>
The Ruins of Rackfall is an adventure full of action, intrigue, horror
and dramatic reverses for a group of four to six seventh level
adventurers.
