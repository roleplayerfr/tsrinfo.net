<center>Long before the Archmagi Zagyg moved into the deeps of the great
castle that came to bear his name, he took up his dwelling in a house north
of the fledgling town of <b>Yggsburgh</b>. The house there he built of
stone, and around it a great fence. Here he hid himself away, nestled in
the deeps of the Little Hillwood.<BR><BR>In the <b>Dark Chateau</b> lay
such places as his laboratories, conservatory, and solarium. He built
donjons beneath and flooded its recesses with all manner of wildness and
incantation, until at last a heavy, brooding darkness lay over the
Chateau. Few visisted the eccentric mage and the fear of his growing
madness spread through the valleys and across the hills of Yggsburgh. But
one day, without warning, the wizard gathered all the myriad materials of
his studies, closed its doors and removed himself from the Chateau. Later
the folk of Yggsburgh learned that Zagyg had settled in the great castle
that his magicks constructed, whereat he continued his many and varied
arcane studies.<BR><BR>And the <b>Dark Chateau</b> was far from his
thought and fell into disuse and ruin.<BR><BR>Goblins came to haunt the
hills about and many times set to plundering the old house. But something
in the house kept them at bay. A greater haunting, or the lingering
malice of the Archmage, few could say. But folk began to talk of the
Zagyg's forgotten treasure... of wealth unimagined that the fearsome
fellow had abandoned in his madness.<BR><BR>There in the lonely hills lies
the <b>Dark Chateau</b> and the wealth of the Mage's early years, all
tokens for the taking if the adventurer be brave and have the fortitude to
bury his comrades in the halls of the dead.<BR><BR><b>Designed For the
Castles & Crusades Role Playing Game</b></center>
