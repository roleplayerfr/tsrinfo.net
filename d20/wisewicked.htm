The Wise and the Wicked</i> introduces a host of extraordinary movers
and shakers - those who carry out the will of the fates and who can be
valuable friends, useful resources or tenacious foes for the player
characters of your campaign. Herein you will meet King Virduk, master
of a vast and powerful empire of evil, and his wife Geleeda, beautiful
and black-hearted. Also introduced are heroes like Katonis, vigilant
of Vesh; Meerlah the Bard, infamous throughout the realm; and Andelais
the incarnate, servant of nature. As for Yugman the Sage, the mysterious
and capricious source of wisdom and knowledge: who can say what side <i>
he</i> is on? These people and others lurk within the pages of this
volume, a compendium of fascinating characters suitable for campaigns
in both the Scarred Lands and elsewhere - the kind and the cruel, the
courageous and the craven and, of course, <i>The Wise and the Wicked</i>.
