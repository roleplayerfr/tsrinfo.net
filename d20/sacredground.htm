Continuing in the tradition of <a href="strongholds.htm"><i>Seven
Strongholds</i></a> and <a href="7cities.htm"><i>Seven Cities</i></a>,
<i>Sacred Ground</i> presents four plug-and-play holy sites useful as PC home
bases, as adventure settings, or as lairs for the characters' next adversary.
It features:<BR><BR><ul><li>GABRIEL'S AERIE: A small, verdant island of earth
floats one mile above the surface of the world, supporting a temple dedicated
to the myriad spirits of wind and air. Its marble domes shine respledently in
the sunlight, and winged creatures drift lazily around the temple on warm air
currents, while temple priests don membranous frames - artificial wings - in
order to join them.</ul><ul><li>RETREAT OF THE WARRIOR SAINT: The oldest
surviving temple to the Warrior Saint - a minor deity who once led the common
people against their oppessor - is a training school for those who would learn
to fight against tyranny by using common tools and their own bodies.</ul><ul><li>
SUMMER'S BARROW: Each autumn, the Summer God comes to a secret location and
dies, his body lying in a massive burial mound guarded by his faithful until
his spirit returns to re-animate it in spring.</ul><ul><li>THE NECROPOLIS: A
vast, barren necropolis island is maintained by the Order of the White Rose -
servants of the god of death. These priests must carefully weigh every
decision to raise or resurrect a mortal who dies within their purview.</ul>
