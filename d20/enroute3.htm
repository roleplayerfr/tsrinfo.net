<center><b><i>Looking for Adventure?</i></b></center><BR>The life of
an adventurer is never an easy one. But now, instead of run-of-the-mill
dungeon denizens, prepare yourself for an interdimensional scholar
intent on "studying" certain great heroes, an inept wizard whose
potions are unpredictable to say the least, a crystalline trap
designed to catch unwary teleporters, an animated forest, living toy
marionettes, giants ready for a rousing game of Dodge Rock, an
intangible creature that feeds on secrets, evil cattle, and a horde
of other horrors to bar your way!<BR><BR>Like the original
<a href="http://home.flash.net/brenfrow/d20/enroute.htm"><i>En Route</i></a> and

<i>En Route III</i> collection presents short encounters that GMs
can easily insert into longer adventures of their own design, or
use as transitions between published modules. <i>En Route III</i>
features innovative scenarios suitable for a wide range of locations
and character levels, each designed to be played in about one
hour's time. This book is a treasure trove of adventure ideas for
