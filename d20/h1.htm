<center><b>Ages of Buried Evil</b></center><BR>The Bonegarden is a
small nation ruled by the dead, a circular cemetery 1 mile in
diameter, surrounded by a magical containment field that keeps its
denizens from spilling into the innocent world beyond. Within the
gate lies one of the true blights of the Domain of Hawkmoon, an
immense graveyard that serves as the prison for the doomed spirits
of thousands of history's most awful criminals. Those inside are
determined to escape, and one of them may have found a way....<BR><BR>
<center><b>An Endless Forum of Adventure</b></center><BR>The
cemetery is a self-contained battlefield that abounds with undead
of types the heroes have never seen, each with its own special plan
for escaping its eternal confinement. <i>The Bonegarden</i>
contains dozens of new spells, feats, monsters, and magic items.
All the action takes place inside a mile-wide arena where the
dead are the majority and the living are hunted like wild game.
The heroes have come to the cemetery in search of adventure. The
only question is... can they get out?<BR><BR><center><i>Designed
