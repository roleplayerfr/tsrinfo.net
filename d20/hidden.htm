You enter the office of the Merchant Guildmaster, heeding the summons
of the courier who interrupted your breakfast at the inn this morning.
The Guildmaster sits behind a vast desk made of some unknown, exotic
wood.<BR><BR>The Guildmaster gazes at each of you in turn. "Thank you
for agreeing to this meeting. We have heard many tales of your
adventures, of the services you have rendered and the quests you have
undertaken on behalf of so many, both lordly and common."<BR><BR>The
Guildmaster's eyes drift to one of the maps hanging on the wall, one
that charts the great mountain range to the north. "This guild trades
extensively with the mountain dwarves, largely for precious metal of
all varieties. Recently, the dwarves lost contact with one of their
most valuable mines, Silverhall, which lies in the heart of those
mountains."<BR><BR>"Our dwarven friends have dispatched two seperate
parties to travel to the mines and return with word of what has
transpired there. Neither has been heard from since leaving the
dwarven holdfast. The dwarves have now entreated us for our assistance,
and we intend to provide it."<BR><BR>The Guildmaster reaches into a
desk and draws forth a large leather bag that clinks enticingly when he
places it before you. "We ask you to travel to Silverhall and learn
what has happened there. If, as I fear, something terrible has
befallen the miners, do all that is in your power to find and rescue
any that yet live. Do this, and you shall have our gold and our
gratitude."<BR><BR>You're not sure which is more valuable, but both
could come in handy.
