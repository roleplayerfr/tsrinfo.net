Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
A recent earthquake has exposed an ancient ziggurat long buried in the
earth. When the heroes are called to investigate, they find more than
just a buried structure. The dragon-queen Tiamat was slain on this site,
and the ziggurat was built eons ago to seal her taint. Now that it
has resurfaced, evil magics flow into the surrounding lands! The heroes
must descend into this ancient edifice, defeat the monsters that dwell
within its bowels, and replace that seal that prevents Tiamat's evil
from leaking into the world!
<BR><BR>If you enjoy this adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl
Classics series!
