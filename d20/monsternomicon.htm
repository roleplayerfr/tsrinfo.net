<i><b>"For generations now, men have feared the shadows of our realm,
told tales of things that go bump in the dark, and cowered behind

the wild expanses of Immoren now for several years, hunting out these
shadows and sounds, and I have come to one conclusion: we're all going
to need some bigger locks."<BR>-Professor Viktor Pendrake</b><BR><BR>
