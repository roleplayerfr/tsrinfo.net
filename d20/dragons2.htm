<center><b>MYTH * WONDER * AWE</b><BR><BR><i>There was a time, my good
friend, when dragons did not walk the earth. But man has never known
such a time. In fact, to speculate about such a time sparks only a
cruel hope. It is a fable for children; those humans that wish for
such a world sharpen their blades for a battle they surely cannot win.<BR><BR>
Man is destined to serve, cowering in fear beneath the shadow of the
dragons - magnificent beasts of such magnitude that words fail to
describe them. They cannot be fathomed by our primitive minds. Surely,
we can see them, talk about them, hunt them, even catalog them in arcane
works lost to the whim of age. But we cannot, and shall not in my
lifetime, ever know what truly makes these wondrous forces of nature
what they are.<BR><BR>I only hope that future generations of man habe
the will to fight against that which cannot be destroyed.</i></center><BR>
