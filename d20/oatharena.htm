The vast red desert domain of Arena sprawls south and westward from the
nurturing plains of Penance. Spurred onward by the ancient promise of gold
buried beneath the sands, massive armies of brutal warriors rumble across
the scarred and wasted terrain. For the fortunate few, the ultimate
dream of Arena still comes true - immeasurable riches, supreme command, and
decades of extravagant and luxurious living atop the Queen's pedestal of
pleasure. For most however, whatever dreams they may harbor are soundly
crushed under years of backbreaking labor, constant battle, exhausting
marches, gruesome butchery, and an infinity of accursed crimson sand.
