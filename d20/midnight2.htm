<i>A hundred years have passed since the Shadow fell...</i><BR><BR>As the
Third Age came to an end, the fallen god Izrador triumphed over the free
nations of Aryth. The corrupt lieutenants of the Shadow in the North, the
Night Kings, rule with an iron fist over ruined cities and broken kingdoms.
Twisted spirits hunt down the last true masters of magic. The dark god's
vile priesthood, the legates of the Order of Shadow, seek out elven spies,
dwarven insurgents, and the few brave humans who stand defiant against
the night in the Age of Shadow.<BR><BR>MIDNIGHT SECOND EDITION is a
reenvisioning and updating of the award-winning and acclaimed <a href="midnight.htm">
MIDNIGHT</a> setting. Everything you need to adventure in the Last Age of
Eredane can be found within, whether you are a player or a DM, new to the
setting or a veteran of the resistance. This volume includes the content
from the original <a href="midnight.htm">MIDNIGHT</a> core
setting book and the player's guide <a href="midshadow.htm">
<i>Against the Shadow</i></a>. New rules from both books have been
compiled, streamlined, and updated. The setting information has been
expanded and deepened, including all-new content on the Northern Marches
and the orcs who were bred there. The DM's section has been expanded as
well, and now includes information on all the creatures of Aryth,
detailed maps, adventure ideas, and more!
