<center><b>I HAVE ROAMED FAR; FARTHER THAN ANY OTHER OF MY RACE EVER
WANDERED, I SUSPECT. I HAVE SEEN ALL THE GREAT CITIES; I HAVE ROAMED THE
UNKNOWN COUNTRIES SOUTH OF THE BLACK KINGDOM OF KUSH, AND EAST OF THE SEA
OF VILAYET. I HAVE BEEN A MERCENARY, A CORSAIR, A NOMAD, A VAGABOND AND
A GENERAL - BY ALL THE GODS I KNOW, I HAVE BEEN EVERYTHING EXCEPT A KING,
AND I MAY BE THAT, BEFORE I DIE. THIS IS AS GOOD A LIFE AS ANY. I DO NOT
KNOW HOW LONG I WILL STAY IN THE SHADOWS, BUT IT IS AS WELL IN THE SHADOWS
AS ANYWHERE ELSE I KNOW.</b><BR><BR>Pirates, thieves and temptresses: the
fallen classes of the Hyborian age who live amongst the shadows, lurking
and hiding in the dark recesses of every city. Civilised people often
presume the light of the law comes from the gods or even from strange
arcane tomes wherein such truths are written. To such people, actions
are either correct or incorrect and a culture of guilt arises from
violating those tenets laid down by society. However, societies who try
to live by the light of the law inherently breed shadows, those
individuals who live outside the light of the laws of their way of life.
These are Hyboria's fallen, by-products of all the impulses contrary to
a given society's definitions of truth and order. Some consider these
people evil; other, more philosophical minds see them as a necessity.
Many who openly condemn them secretly long to give in to their shadows.
As Hyboria's fiercest are forces of nature impacting upon society and her
finest are the guardians of civilisation, so Hyboria's fallen represent
impulsive temptation; those who reject the restraints insisted upon by
the finest and challenged by the fiercest. To be one of the fallen is
to be hunted and to have your deeds and beliefs treated as sinful,
criminal or worse.<BR><BR>This book introduces a new core class to the
world of Conan, that of the temptress, those men and women who subvert
authority with their charms and who refuse to give in to the laws
dictated to them by those who dominate Hyborian society. Commonly
labelled whore and Lotharios, these ignorant classifications are borne
of fear and an attempt to belittle those who have the strength to stand
up to the establishment.<BR><BR>This book discusses how the various
cultures of Conan's age look at the pirate, thief and temptress classes
and gives advice on those skills and feats that emphasise each culture's
iconic interpretations of the three classes. Within are the secrets of
Hyboria's Fallen, including information, tips and rules for using one's
body to its utmost, archetypal roles, and details of Hyboria's crime
families and thieves' guilds. New poisons and rules regarding shock and
surprise are given, along with new combat manoeuvres to vary both
combat and character concepts, allowing you to create entirely
individual pirates, thieves and temptresses.</center>
