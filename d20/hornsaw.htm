Mormo, Lady of Serpents, was defeated at the height of the Divine War. Her body
was ripped apart, her foul blood and flesh raining down upon the peaceful
Broadreach Forest. Today, that once idyllic place is known as the Hornsaw, a
place of horror where monstrous titanspawn lurk and the followers of Mormo
seek to recover and restore her dismembered body.<BR><BR>Yet hope has returned
to the forest. Long absent, the Broadreach elves now strive to reclaim their
lost lands and drive out the titanspawn. Though few, the desire for vengeance
and redemption burns bright in their elven hearts. So begins the struggle for
the Hornsaw's souls - which valarous adventurers may influence, for good or
ill.<BR><BR>Walk the hidden paths of the Hornsaw, but be sure to have sword or
spell at the ready.
