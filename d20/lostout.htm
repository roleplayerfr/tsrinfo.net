<center><b>A Bloody Beginning</b></center><BR>Storming a fortress is
never easy. Especially a fortress full of smart, disciplined orcs.
But that's just what you'll have to do in The Lost Outpost. In this,
the first installment of the Pale Knight series, these uncouth
humanoids have seized a long-abandoned elven outpost in the Dragonspine
Mountains. It seems to have no tactical value, but the elves are
taking no chances. You've been hired to clear it out.<BR><BR>How do
you go about assaulting a manned, fortified stronghold? Why do the
orcs want it in the first place? And just who taught orcs to fight
like soldiers?<BR><BR>Maybe you'll find the answers to these questions,
or maybe you'll fiind a grisly death at the hands of a den of orcs!<BR><BR>
<center>The Lost Outpost is a D20 system adventure suitable for third
to fourth level characters.</center>
