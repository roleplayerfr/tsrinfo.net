PERIL</b></center><BR>In Shelzar the Wicked, every desire can be fulfilled for
those able to pay the price. Said to be half as old as Scarn itself, Shelzar
has survived conquest, catastrophe and chaos to emerge as the continent's
capital of decadence and sin. This volume contains a complete history of
Shelzar, details of its inhabitants, locations, and culture, as well as
adventures to challenge to most jaded of player characters.<BR><BR>Venture to
the most decadent city of Ghelspad, learn its secrets and partake of its
pleasures, but never let your guard down, for death comes as quickly as delight
in Shelzar's smoke-filled chambers and shadowed alleys, and the hand that
delivers a soft caress one moment can hold a poisoned dagger the next. Desire
and danger are one in the City of Sins
