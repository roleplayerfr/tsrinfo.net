<center><b>GOD * KING * COUNTRY</b><BR><BR><i>For thousands of years we
have fought. If not with the orcs and goblins and ogres and miscreants
so foul it burns your eyes just to say their names, we have warred
within. None know more the ways of warfare and combat than our people.
We have suffered under the banne of oppression or fought under the flags
of prosperity, but always we have fought to keep ourselves safe.<BR><BR>
I have sworn an oath to die protecting my king and I pledge my sword to
forever serve him. I pledge to rid this place of all beasts foul and
contemptable. May the people of Westbrook never know fear again, so
long as we ride in valor and nobility to challenge the unkempt creatures
of the earth.<BR><BR>For the people!</center><BR></i>-General Anyk'dar,
High Commander of Westbrook and Last Defender of the Wind<BR><BR><center><b>
