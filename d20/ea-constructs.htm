<b>IT IS ALIVE<BR><BR>The Ultimate Creation</b><BR><BR>Golems wait
silently in dungeon corridors, ready to apprehend unwary adventurers
who dare defile their former master's sanctum. Shield guardians follow
their owners faithfully, interposing themselves between the holder of
their amulet and anything that would bring him harm. Homonculi fly
forth, powered by their creator's lifeblood into a grotesque mockery of
life. All of these are constructs, artificial life forms brought into
the world by rituals long secreted away in the corners of occult
libraries, in the ruins of mighty magical empires and the personal notes
of spellcasters with the curiosity to explore this field of arcane lore.<BR><BR>
<b>Inside You Will Find:<BR><BR>Constructs - An Overview:</b> An
in-depth look at the crafting of constructs and the differences between
golems, automatons and simulacra.<BR><BR><b>The Drawing Board:</b> Full
rules for building your very own construct!<BR><BR><b>The Artisan's
Craft:</b> Details and costs of building a construct of any size, from
the Adamantine Golem to the Clockwork Automaton.<BR><BR><b>Building a
Better Construct:</b> The mere building of a construct is by no means

and improved, making them utterly lethal to the wizard's enemies.<BR><BR><b>

and feats that can be incorporated into a constructs design.<BR><BR><b>
