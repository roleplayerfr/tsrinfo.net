<center>The Druid class embraces all the elements that make for an interesting
and fun adventurer, combat prowess, powerful spells and a strange but potent
wisdom. The druid can be at home as much in the city or town as in the
wilderness. From the local woodland glen to the thick, rolling forests rich
with mystical and celestial energies in the outer planes, the druid can be
found protecting his world from those that would destroy living creatures for
personal gain. By memorising the right spells, adapating to any terrain better
than any other character, the Druid has at hand the tools he needs to survive
no matter where the adventure takes him.<BR><BR>The mystery and majesty of the
druid, his rich and versatile career, are all detailed within this book. There
are few places a druid cannot venture and a million new creatures to meet and
befriend as he reaps the rewards of his own special relationship with the
power of nature. <i>The Quintessential Druid</i> will take such a character
all the way from 1<sup><font size="-1">st</font></sup> level to the 20<sup><font size="-1">th</font></sup>
and far beyond.<BR><BR><b>Inside you will find:</center><BR>Character Concepts<BR><BR>
