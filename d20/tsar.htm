<center><b>The Tsar is Dead!</b></center><BR>The cry echoes across
Torassia: the cruel tyrant fell in a battle with undead troops,
abandoned by the two princes in his time of need. The empty throne
creates anarchy and chaos, as the princes and the Tsar's advisor battle
for the right to rule. As if that wasn't bad enough, the worst winter
that Torassia has ever experienced leaves frozen corpses in villages
everywhere. It's a race against time as Sergei, the Tsar's commander
in chief, gallops southwards to reach the capital before the forces
of hell get there first.<BR><BR>Will you brave the coming storm?<BR><BR><center>
Tsar Rising is a D20 system adventure suitable for eighth to ninth
level characters.</center>
