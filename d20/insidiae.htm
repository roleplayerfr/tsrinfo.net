<center>GYGAXIAN FANTASY WORLDS VOLUME V<BR><BR>Adventure scenarios are an
indispensable part of all role-playing games. Few players would be content
generating fictional characters who engage only in activities outside of any
meaningful narrative. Combat, role-playing, and problem solving are all
essential elements of adventure design. But alone they lack the fire and iron
of great story telling. These key elements must be bound together. This
volume covers five vitally important aspects of game adventure design: back
story, antagonists, motive, locale and plot. Insidiae is organized to aid in
creating events which facilitate matrix style adventures, promoting freedom of
choice and movement for the players, avoiding linear, constrictive scenarios.
Adventures must not "lead by the nose", dragging characters lock-step through
a clunky, linear plot. And resolution should allow for continuance; the promise
of greater glory and danger in an ongoing campaign.<BR><BR>Insidiae breaks new
ground designers, professional or amateur, writers or anyone who has ever wanted
to unravel the mysteries of good adventure or story writing!<BR><BR><BR>Requires
the use of the Dungeons & Dragons, Third Edition Core Books, published by
Wizards of the Coast, Inc.<BR><BR><a href="http://www.trolllord.com/"><b>
