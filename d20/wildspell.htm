<center>In traditional legends, magic has always been a force that
granted great power, but which carried risk in its use.<BR>For those
who appreciate this uncertainty and desire to let magic be something
mystical and untamable, something more than just an entry on the spells
per day table, Natural 20 Press and Mystic Eye Games present Wild
Spellcraft.<BR>Wild Spellcraft will provide game masters with a
toolkit for including the unpredictable forces of magic in their game
with whatever depth and complexity they want. Ranging from rules for
spells gone awry to prestige classes for those who try to master magic
in its rawest, most chaotic form, Wild Spellcraft is designed to be
modular, to f it into your game in individual pieces or in its
entirety.<BR><BR><b>Requires the use of Dungeons & Dragons <a href="../3e/phb.htm">
