you will find more than a dozen fully-developed organizations to enhance
your campaign, from the terrifying and secretive Cult of the Ancients -
murderous servants of an evil goddess - to the noble Paladins of Corean,
valorous defenders of faith. <i>Secrets and Societies</i> includes
the history and background of each organization, statistics for
typical members and leaders, as well as new spells, magic items, feats,
and prestige classes unique to each organization. Learn about the
foul knights who become Black Dragoons, about the alluring Courtesans of
Idra whose network of spies plagues the bedrooms of kings, and learn
about the strange and fearful allies of the necromantic mercenaries
called the Legion of Ash. All this and more can be found within the
pages of <i>Secrets and Societies</i>, a sourcebook that will enhance
any campaign, in both the Scarred Lands and elsewhere.</center>
