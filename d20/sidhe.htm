As anyone born in the Glamour Isles will tell you, what you see in the
mists is not always what is really there. Whether on land or sea, there is
a power more ancient than the Syrneth, a force that comes from the earth
itself and can take a myriad of forms from bone-chilling horror to
heart-stopping beauty. When you open this book, you will come face to
face with the world of the Sidhe - not as the distant and aloof creatures
you may have encountered in your previous travels, but as they truly are -
a complex race of beings driven to experience Théah in every way possible.
As you will see, the Kingdom of Bryn Bresail holds many surprises, not all
of them pleasant...<BR><BR><ul><li>The history of the Sidhe and their
