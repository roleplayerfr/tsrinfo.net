Arcanis is a world of high fantasy, intrigue, and suspense. Diplomacy, skill,
and discretion will carry you as far or farther than skill at arms or in the arts
of magic. Heroes come in a myriad of forms. Some are fantastic beings born
with the blood of Valinor or the souls of elementals. Others are the descendents
of Celestial Giants who once roamed the stars as freely as a fish swims the sea.
Many of the greatest heroes of Arcanis are simple mortals of mundane blood but
lofty ideals. It is a world of heroes who stand between the common folk and
destruction. You can be that hero. The power is in your hands; leave your mark
