<i>The dogs in the woods begin barking, baying wildly at a setting sun.
The woodsmen look up from their work. The whack of their axes stop,
and all of them feel their doom. "What is it?"<BR><BR>"Quiet son,
quiet. Pick up your axe boy!"<BR><BR>"Father?"<BR><BR>"Do as your
father says son." Krugor of Fruborg glances fearfully to his left,
then to his right. A bead of sweat rolls across his temple. His hand
shakes as he grips his axe more tightly.<BR><BR>Ulrike looks around and
feels the breath of Odesfale, the whiff of death lingers ominously in
the cold air. A tear comes to his eye and the words of the Fates of
Kreutzmark come to his mind, "When your time comes, you will know."<BR><BR>
The dogs go quiet.</i><BR><BR>The action-filled, epic conclusion to the
<i>Death on the Treklant Trilogy</i>! You have raised the ire of
goblin warlord, and now you flee his kingdom with war parties hot on
your trail. You must reach the borderland town of Felsentheim, for if
you do not, no alarm will sound to harken the coming of the Dogs of
War! Shall you claim the glory of heroes, or accept your doom?<BR><BR>
Enter again the World of Inzae, where all things slip into the Maelstrom,
and from hence true heroes are born. <i>Felsentheim: Dogs of War</i>,
is a d20 System adventure for 4-6 characters of levels 3-5. It provides
