<center>The explorer is a rare individual, who willingly leaves his home and
all that he knows to seek out the unknown. Whether for their own sake, or for
the fame and fortune they bring, explorers travel the hidden places of the world
on a quest for the new and unusual. Explorers live for the challenge of
venturing into hitherto unseen places, overcoming myriad dangers and encountering
strange men and beasts. Possessed of great fortitude and resourcefulness, as
well as uncommon bravery, the explorer excels not only in the wilds but also
among the being he comes upon in his travels. Rare is the circumstance that
catches him off guard.<BR><BR>
This is the 8<sup><font size="-1">th</font></sup> book of the <i>Power Classes</i>
series from Mongoose publishing. Designed to be seamlessly slotted into any fantasy-based d20
system game, each of these mini-supplements introduce an entirely new core
character class, adding a whole new dimension to campaigns. Players will find
full details on how to use the new character class, greatly increasing the
wealth of options they are presented with by the core rulebooks while Games
Masters may revel in the wide variety of new classes they have at their
disposal for non-player characters in their campaigns. Each Power Class
booklet can provide hours of gaming enjoyment at an all new low cost.<BR><BR><b>
