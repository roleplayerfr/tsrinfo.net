<i><center><b>A Path Unearthed</b><BR>For long years, the Temple of
Kubla Khan stood, a lonely edifice in the waste. Here the Khan's priests
had paid homage to the demi-god of war. But, with the years their
numbers dwindled and eventually the Temple fell into ruin. It stood
unoccupied for ages until Yuggilv, the Crawling Queen, came to reside
there, making the Temple a nightmarish prison. Unknown to the Queen, her
prison's foundation were a Tomb's ceiling. Over all these long years the
Tomb of Kubla Khan, long ago sealed to prying eyes, lay forgotten, hidden
beneath the Temple's floors. But in time, a band of doughty adventurers
managed to win their way into the Prison of Yuggilv. Through horrific
struggles they came to her den and cast her and her foul minions to the
abyss. Unbeknowst to them, they unearthed the hidden portals that led to
the entrance of the Tombs themselves, far below the surface.<BR><BR><b>
War in the Lands of the Dead</b><BR>A horror lies within the Khan's Tomb.
Few who have entered have returned and those who have gibber madness of
dark places and strange, nighmarish creatures. They speak of insects the
size of men who have weapons and shields of iron. They babble of the
priest of the dead and the war between the insects and his beasts of
madness. But there are rumors too, rumors of a wealth beyond imagining.
The old Khan hoarded mounds of gold and gems, artifacts and relics of
power to hurry his passage to the divinity he ever sought in life and
strove to achieve after his death. It is this hint of wealth that calls
the intrepid adventurer to the Tomb of Kubla Khan.<BR>The Tomb of Kubla
Khan is an adventure module designed for 4-6 characters of 7-9th level.<BR><BR>
Special Collector's Edition Module<BR>This special edition module is only
one of three hundred printed. The Temple of Kubla Khan has been designed
