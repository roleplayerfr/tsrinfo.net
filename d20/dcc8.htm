Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
Originally designed as a convention tournament module, this adventure sends
the heroes into the underdark to do battle against the mysterious denizens
of the deep! A drow housemistress commissions the characters to acquire
a mysterious weapon known to be in the hands of her dark elf enemies.
Locating, identifying, and acquiring the magical weapon leads the heroes
on a great trek across the underdeep, where they must battle svirfneblin,
a powerful lich, and enemy drow. This adventure is specially designed for
play by drow characters, but can be used with any adventuring party.
Pregenerated drow characters are included.<BR><BR>
If you enjoy this adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl Classics
series!
