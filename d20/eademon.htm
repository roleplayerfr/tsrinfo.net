<center>Welcome, mortal, to the Dark Road. Within these secret pages
you will find the most forbidden knowledge of all - that of summoning,
binding and ultimately controlling the demons, devils and fiends of the
infernal planes. This book is not for the faint of heart for only the
strongest of wills may dare to dabble in the blackest art of all. The
perils are great and the dangers terrifying but for those willing to
gamble their very souls, the rewards are far greater than any mortal
can possibly conceive.<BR><BR>Encyclopaedia Arcane: Demonology - The
Dark Road provides Games Masters and players alike with all the
information they need to introduce this dangerous form of magic into
their campaigns. The Demonologist character class is presented
alongside those who go far deeper into the art, the mysterious Binder
and the dreaded Possessed. Each has access to the most incredible
powers, drawn from the very forces of evil itself.<BR><BR>How far will
you dare travel the Dark Road?<BR><BR><BR>FOR PLAYERS AND GAMES MASTERS
