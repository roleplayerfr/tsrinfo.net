Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
The Stormbringer family of storm giants has long extorted gold from
coastal towns as a "good weather tax." Fed up by rising taxes, the towns
recently sent a band of stalwart adventurers to finish off Stozari
Stormbringer for good (as witnessed in <a href="dcc21.htm">
DCC #21: Assault on Stormbringer Castle</a>). But when the adventurers
struck down Stozari, they only made her more powerful. Through eldritch
rituals, her life force has been transferred by her daughter into the
Stormbringer Juggernaut, a massive 800-foot-long giant-scaled assault
ship bristling with weapons of war. Capable of laying siege to a large
city or defeating an entire navy of human ships, the juggernaut is a
potent weapon to bring larger cities under the control of the Stormbringers.
Now this living juggernaut has set sail for the coast, and only the
heroes can stop it!

Classics series!
