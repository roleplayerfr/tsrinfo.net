<i>"No introductions are necessary for I know well who you are my
intrepid adventurer. Have a seat my friend before you enter the
Graffenvold and traverse its byways. Have you come here to rest, to
leave the muddy tracks and sharp edges of the world behind? Is that it
my fine fellow? Or have you come to beat down the lords of this Land
and submit them to your will? Which is it fellow, the easy of the
hard road you are after?<BR><BR>"I fear you have gone beyond yourself,
and here in Inzae your mistake may be your doom. For beyond yonder
door is a fearful world clinging desperately to life. Its denizens
struggle against a vast array of malignant forces that seek to drag
them deeper into the pits of the Maelstrom. And even here, in this
backwater called Rentier, you will find no respite from the struggle.
So take heed traveler, take heed as you enter the Graffenvold. It will
do you well to remember that this is a deadly world and lest you take
care, you will be engulfed in its dying spasms."</i><BR><BR>Travel
south into the goblin kingdoms is always frought with danger. Many go
only as far as the Baron's outpost, Vakhund, the Watchdog Tower, and
reside there in safety while merchants and others fare their way further
down the road. But what happens when Vakhund Tower is attacked by
goblins, orcs, and bandits? A noble is kidnapped, and only a dangerous
trip into the dark,infested goblin kingdoms will reveal the answer.<BR><BR>
A d20 System adventure intended for 4-8 characters of levels 1-2, <i>
Vakhund: Into the Unknown</i> marks Part I in the thrilling <i>Death on
the Treklant Trilogy</i> and introduces the grimly realistic world of
Inzae. Those brave enough to enter her Maelstrom and become heroes
shall linger long in the halls of valor and memory.<BR><BR>Requires the
