When traveling along the northern frontier, you're always prepared for
the worst. But the bitter storm that blew in from the mountains seemed
to come out of nowhere, and the bleak landscape offers little protection
from the harsh wind, blinding snow, and biting cold.<BR><BR>When you
discovered the small vale and quiet village, it seemed like a godsend.
A roof over your head, a warm fire, and hearty food have all served to
banish the memory of the storm, though you can still hear the wind
howling outside.<BR><BR>The Toruke have lived in peace in their
isolated vale for many years. They are an unusual people, with smoky
gray skin and rather severe features that are quite at odds with their
calm and cheerful demeanors.<BR><BR>There's more to the Thoruke than
meets the eye, though. You're sure of it. What secrets hide behind
those dark, lively eyes? What painful memory lies buried here? What
great tragedy has befallen these simple people that weighs so heavily
on their spirits?<BR><BR>Their stories speak of the wrath of an old
enemy, of the vengeance of a dark goddess. Outside, the wind and snow
still lash the simple timber lodgings of the village. But you wonder...<BR><BR>
Is there another storm coming?
