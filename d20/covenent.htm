Everyone knows about the Lich on Covenent Hill. His tale is older than
the town that has grown up in its shadow, more ancient even than the
forest that surrounds them both. For hundreds of years he has walked
the nearby beaches, searching for the bodies of shipwrecked sailors.
Yet the Old One has never ventured toward the village, and nothing
disturbs his silent hermitage. The land is at peace, though soft moans
still whisper on the long shadows of night and the peasants of
Heathwyck tell tales of ghosts and spirits that walk the ancient
garrison's barren grounds.<BR><BR>But on recent nights, the old tales
have begun to come true. Once the tales of undead were no more than
moans in the wind. Now, dead rise from the graves of Heathwyck,
marching one by one into the night. The people of Heathwyck are
frightened, and it seems that the Old One turns his eyes at last
toward the town below. The peace that has existed for centuries has
been broken, and peasants who stay too late in the fields are slaughtered
by undead while the moon shines brightly above. More graves open, and
the dead stumble toward the ancient garrison as if drawn by some
unknown force - a command they cannot resist.<BR><BR>Something terrible
whispers in the wind of Covenant Hill....
