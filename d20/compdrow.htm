<center><b>NO ADVENTURER IS SAFE WHILE THE DARK ELVES STILL PROWL THE
UNDERDARK</b><BR><BR><i>This definitive sourcebook opens the door to a new
world of power and intrigue...</i></center><BR>Drow are the most feared
denizens of the underdark, and with good reason. Since the civil war that
first exiled the dark elves under the earth, they have been forced to
fight for survival in a hostile environment. Watched over by dark gods
with cruel ambitions, the drow have spent thousands of years evolving into
scheming, power-hungry warlords. This book tells their story.<BR><BR>The
Complete Guide to Drow is a stand-alone, world-neutral sourcebook covering
everything you ever wanted to know about drow. It focuses on aspects of
the drow that escape coverage in conventional sources. You'll learn about:<BR><BR <ul><li>Drow mutations and half-breeds, including the half-demon shur and
half-goblin urbam.<li>The secretive professions found only amongst the
drow: the demon-calling Keepers, the shadowy Dark Blades, the perverse
Blood Druids, the half-machine Adamantine Soldiers, and others.<li>The
magic, equipment, poisons, and feats of the drow.<li>The subterranean
society of the drow, including the horrific war machines they build from
the hollowed-out shells of giant beetles.</ul>The Complete Guide to Drow
is 100% stand-alone and world-neutral. It can be integrated easily into
any fantasy setting.
