With this sourcebook's in-depth look at the hidden rules of political intrigue
and power brokering, you will too. Players will use this book to unravel the
schemes of duplicitous enemies and allies alike as part of their rise to power.
GMs get a close look at the gritty details of political campaigns fraught with
plots and counter-plots, assassinations, duels, and changing allegiances, all
tied together in a byzantine web of power relations.<BR><BR><i>Dynasties and

any D20 System campaign setting. Designed for both players and GMs, it

transfers written information directly from a book to your mind.</ul><ul><li>15
magic items like the <i>fly on the wall</i> surveillance device, and the <i>
seeking arrow</i> that carries a message up to 6,000 miles through the air to
land at your recipient's feet.</ul><ul><li>20 general feats like Commanding
Voice, Inspire Frenzy, and Information Network, plus 24 new personality feats
that let players gain extra experience for accomplishing roleplaying goals.</ul><ul><li>
9 prestige classes that allow characters to become bodyguards, conspiracy
leaders, information mages, religious leaders, and rise to a position of power
like that of the true demagogue.</ul><ul><li>Details on maneuvering within
eight distinct political settings, from anarchy to empire, with examples of how
classic elements like magic and fantasy races impact them.</ul><ul><li>
Easy-to-use rules for conducting debates, council votes, elections, and
tournaments.</ul><ul><li>Blueprints for political adventure and campaign
construction, one short adventure, five developed adventure premises, and
