So you want to join the Minutemen? You think you have what it takes?<BR><BR>
We'll see tonight<BR><BR>Six crimes in 12 hourse, that shouldn't be too
difficult, right.<BR><BR>It's not. Not until you see the "shopping"
list.<BR><BR>Steal the journal from the Herbalist and Witch, Madame
Byanca.<BR><BR>Find a precious and rare Black Diamond, hidden somewhere
in the city.<BR><BR>Retrieve the Lord Rhelgin's sword.<BR><BR>Kidnap
Father Milas Tomor, a Priest of Pelor.<BR><BR>Leave a bloody dagger in
the room of Regent Petralis.<BR><BR>Last... we'll save that one for

you say? Let's hope not. The penalty for failure is imprisonment.
You see, the guild has a deal with the local constable. Anyone who
fails to pass the guild's initiation is handed over to the constable and
imprisoned for past crimes, real or otherwise. The guards enjoy a short
period of glory for "solving the crimes" and the guild gets rid of a
few worthless recruits.<BR><BR>Good luck!<BR><BR>This adventure may be
played alone or in conjunction with <a href="honoramong.htm"><i>
Honor Among Thieves</i></a>.
