Remember the golden days of role playing, when adventures were underground, NPCs
were there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was the dragon on the
20th level? Well, those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics feature bloody
combat, intriguing dungeons, and no NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each
adventure is 100% good, solid dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the
traps you fear, and the secret doors you know must be there somewhere.<BR><BR>
In Idylls of the Rat King, goblin bandits are once again attacking the silver
caravans, killing innocent miners and stealing cargo. The goblins have taken
up residence in an abandoned mine northwest of Silverton. Someone must get
rid of them. But this is no ordinary abandoned mine. It was deliberately
barricaded generations ago when the Gannu family, founders of Silverton,
discovered an unspeakable evil on its lowest levels. And these are no
ordinary goblins, for the curse of the Gannu family courses through their veins...<BR><BR>
If you enjoy this adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl Classics
series!
