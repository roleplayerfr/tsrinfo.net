<center><b>Ultimate Power</b><BR><BR>Battle magic is about
pushing magic to its absolute destructive limits, turning
each arcane phrase into a death sentence and every
claw-fingered gesture into a deadly magical assault.
Make no mistake - battle magic is about mayhem and death,
ensuring your opponents are made to pay for their
presumption to challenge your arcane might. Whether you
wish to deliver death from afar, firing off massive
spells that streak through the sky and blast massive
holes in the enemy lines, or want to see the look of
fear in your foes' eyes as you come screaming for their
blood with your runeweave robes and spellblade, battle
magic is for you.<BR><BR>In this book, you will find
information on how to craft intricate illusions or
research spells that help your fellow adventurers see in
the dark or span a yawning chasm - you will discover new
spells devoted solely to destruction, new feats that
boost your character's ability to wreak havoc on enemy
forces, and prestige classes to add new fear and respect
for spellcasters in your games. This book is for players
and Games Masters who believe the highest purpose of
magic is to rain death and destruction down upon their
enemies.<BR><BR><b>Inside you will find:</center><BR>
To Gird for Battle:</b> Meet the greatest threats ever
to stalk the battlefields of fantasy. The Battle Mage
studies spells of massive destruction, pulsing waves of
fire that set entire battalions screaming and running
like schoolgirls. When you are ready for a little
guerrilla warfare, just sign up the Eldritch Warrior - a
magical close combat specialist.<BR><BR><b>The Book of
War:</b> Page after page of new spells focusing on pure
destruction. Learn the secrets of <i>elemental rupture</i>
and how to direct a <i>lava wyrm</i> toward your foes.<BR><BR>
<b>The Armoury:</b> The right tool for the job is a must
and this chapter delivers a selection of the finest
arcane ordnance for laying waste to those who oppose you.<BR><BR>
<b>Battle Guilds:</b> Research is expensive and fighting
dangerous. These simple facts of life lead wise mages
to join a Battle Guild, where research expenses are
subsidised and there is always someone to watch your
back.<BR><BR><b>Feats of Battle:</b> No guidebook to
Battle Magic would be complete without a selection of
offensive feats to increase your killing power. Do not
enter the dungeon without them.<BR><BR><b>Help for the
Games Master:</b> Secrets to help even the odds and a
few tricks that Games Masters will find useful when
dealing with Battle Mages and Eldritch Warriors.
