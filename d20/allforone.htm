France, nobles challenge the king's power and commoners question the way of
things. In these times, the Kings of France must have protection: the elite
soldiers known as Musketeers.<BR><BR>ALL FOR ONE lets your players enter the
world of Alexander Dumas, or play in the reality in which he set his novels.
Fight as a King's Musketeer or Cardinal's Guard, or conduct secret missions as
an Intendant. New rules are included for gunpowder weapons and of course no
Musketeer would be complete without panache. All the major characters of
</i>The Three Musketeers<i> and </i>The Man in the Iron Mask<i> are present
as well.</i></center>
