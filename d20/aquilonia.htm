<center><b>KING CONAN SAT ON THE JUDGEMENT THRONE IN THE HALL OF JUSTICE IN
HIS PALACE AT TARANTIA, THE ROYAL CAPITAL OF AQUILONIA. BEYOND WINDOWS OF
STAINED GLASS, BLUE SKIES CURVED OVER GREEN GARDENS BRIGHT AND FRAGRANT
WITH BLOSSOMS. AND BEYOND THE GARDENS, SQUARE TOWERS OF WHITE STONE THRUST
INTO THE SKY, AND DOMES OF GREEN COPPER, AND THE SHAPES OF HOUSES, TEMPLES
AND PALACES ROOFED WITH RED TILES. FOR THIS WAS THE MOST PRINCELY OF
COUNTRIES IN THE ANCIENT DAYS OF THE HYBORIAN AGE.</b><BR><BR>Aquilonia is
the wealthiest and most powerful of the Hyborian kingdoms, peopled with a
proud population better off than most in the distant epoch of the Hyborian
Age. Its barons and counts maintain ancient feuds from generation to
generation and the frontiers fight Picts, Cimmerians, Nemedians, Ophireans
and each other.<BR><BR>In time, Aquilonia will come to play an even more
prominent role in history, as the kingdom comes under the rule of King
Conan. Throughout the tales of the Phoenix on the Sword, The Hour of the
Dragon and The Scarlet Citadel Conan struggles against entirely different
evils to any which he has faced before as the king of Aquilonia. Still
more tales, such as Beyond the Black River and Wolves Beyond the Border,
feature this fascinating kingdom's struggles with the Picts under the
rule of its barbarian king.<BR><BR>Unlike many of the other nations of
the Hyborian Age, Aquilonia is populated by a plethora of different racial
types. From Gundermen to Poitainians, Bossonians to Taurans and many
others besides, each distinctly different, and yet all of them Aquilonians.
What characteristics do these races have in common? What characteristics
do these races have in difference? How are these heterogeneous populations
controlled by a single Aquilonian king? This volume attempts to answer
those questions and more.<BR><BR>In an age and country rife with intrigue,
murder and horror. Aquilonia could easily be the setting for untold
campaigns. From the palatial splendour of the capital, Tarantia, to the
rural tranquility to the Tauran and the brooding nobles of Poitain, this
Campaign Sourcebook for Conan the Roleplaying Game details Hyboria's
greatest kingdom, Aquilonia, the Flower of the West, destined to be ruled
over by the mighty Conan himself and fated to wilt in the hands of the
Picts!</center>
