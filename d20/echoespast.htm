<center><b>FROM THE SHADOWED PAST</b></center><BR>Deep in the history of
the Scarred Lands, the gods and titans joined forces to destroy the
slarecians, a people of strange and terrible power. The full repercussions
of this mighty war remain as much a mystery as its cause. What powers
did the slarecians wield? Why were they such a danger that the mightiest
beings in all of Scarn cast them down? And what of their legacy still
threatens the people of the Scarred Lands in current times?<BR><BR><center>
<b>THE THREAT REMAINS</b></center><BR>This sourcebook explores the
mysterious and potent slarecians, a race with a significant role in the
Scarred Lands - yet intriguing creatures to add to any d20 campaign.

of the mighty subterranean Slarecian Empire, and the legacy these strange
beings have left behind.<BR><BR><center>REQUIRES THE USE OF THE DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
