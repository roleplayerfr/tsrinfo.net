<center>Alchemy is typically a perplexing art for common folk in a fantasy
setting. In any world where the majority of people must toil to survive, the
idea of someone's life work being to stand around boiling liquids and talking
about the 'essense of rare matter' is quite alien to them. Alchemists in a
fantasy world are rarely considered anything other than strange folk with ways
that set them apart from the rest of society. Of course, this is not always
the case. The first time an invading band of humanoids is turned aside by
thunderstones and tanglefoot bags, the alchemist responsible might find himself
very popular indeed.<BR><BR>
This is the tenth book of the Power Classes
series from Mongoose publishing. Designed to be seamlessly slotted into any fantasy-based d20
system game, each of these mini-supplements introduces an entirely new core
character class, adding a whole new dimension to campaigns. Players will find
full details on how to use the new character class, greatly increasing the
wealth of options they are presented with by the core rulebooks while Games
Masters may revel in the wide variety of new classes they have at their
disposal for non-player characters in their campaigns. Each Power Class
booklet can provide hours of gaming enjoyment at an all-new low cost.<BR><BR><b>
