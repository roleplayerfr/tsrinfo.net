The town of Hallows End seemed like the ideal spot to stop over for a
night of rest on your long journey. The small farming village is known
for good people and good ale. The only tavern in town, the Staggering
Giant, seemed like the best place to get a little rest and gave a nice
evening. That was until you walked through the door to hear a deep,
grizzled voice yell, "No! I don't think you understand! You're gonna
tell me where this passage is so me and my crew here can look into it
for ourselves. You'll pay us whatever we ask for and if you can't pay
in coin then we'll just have to take whatever we want to make up the
difference. Even if that means we have to take it out of your lovely
little wife here!"<BR><BR>That was when you noticed a young farmer in
the grasp of a tall dark-haired man and his four companions wearing the
tabards of the local militia. "I told you, you aren't the kind of
people we're looking for. You're a pack of deserters, what makes you
think I would want you anywhere near my land?" the farmer yells with
noble, yet terrified, composure. As the farmer struggles to get free,
his wife lies on the floor next to him, holding the side of her newly
bruised face, tears running down her cheeks. She begs for someone in
the small tavern to help them. "What are all of you staring at? Please!
Someone do something! Help us!" she screams.<BR><BR>It looks like it's
going to be one of those nights...
