<center><b>KNOW, O PRINCE, THAT BETWEEN THE YEARS WHEN THE OCEANS
DRANK ATLANTIS AND THE GLEAMING CITIES, AND THE YEARS OF THE RISE
OF THE SONS OF ARYAS, THERE WAS AN AGE UNDREAMED OF, WHEN SHINING
KINGDOMS LAY SPREAD ACROSS THE WORLD LIKE BLUE MANTLES BENEATH THE
STARS NEMEDIA, OPHIR, BRYTHUNIA, HYPERBOREA, ZAMORA WITH ITS
DARK-HAIRED WOMEN AND TOWERS OF SPIDER-HAUNTED MYSTERY, ZINGARA
WITH ITS CHIVALRY, KOTH THAT BORDERED ON THE PASTORAL LANDS OF
SHEM, STYGIA WITH ITS SHADOW-GUARDED TOMBS, HYRKANIA WHOSE RIDERS
WORE STEEL AND SILK AND GOLD. BUT THE PROUDEST KINGDOM OF THE
WORLD WAS AQUILONIA, REIGNING SUPREME IN THE DREAMING WEST. HITHER
CAME CONAN, THE CIMMERIAN, BLACK-HAIRED, SULLEN-EYED, SWORD IN
HAND, A THIEF, A REAVER, A SLAYER, WITH GIGANTIC MELANCHOLIES
AND GIGANTIC MIRTH, TO TREAD THE JEWELED THRONES OF THE EARTH
UNDER HIS SANDALED FEET.</b><BR><BR>Torn from the pages of
Howard's original vision, <i>Conan The Roleplaying Game</i> is
a faithful realisation of the vivid world of the Cimmerian
barbarian, allowing you to follow in his footsteps and create
adventures, scoundrels and fell sorcerers of the Hyborian
age.<BR><BR>Featuring everything you need to explore the lands
of Hyboria, including a complete system of character creation
and advancement, combat and sorcery, <i>Conan The Roleplaying
Game</i> fully details the world of Conan, from the unknown
islands west of Zingara to the semi-legendary kingdoms beyond
the deserts and steppes of eastern Shem, from the frozen lands
of the Aesir and Vanir to the lush jungles of Kush.<BR><BR>
The world of Conan stands before you.<BR><BR>Dare you Enter?</center>
