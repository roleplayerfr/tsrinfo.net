<center>The noble is the master of the social scene. Through his training and
upbringing, together with his status he excels at taking command of any
situation and turning it to his advantage. Nobles often function as leaders of
society, the cream of the crop who direct others to carry out their goals,
taking part themselves only when it is expedient or the matter is of some
great concern to them. Their training in etiquette, hunting, tactics and the
simple way of how their society hangs together makes them perfect leaders for
adventuring parties.
<BR><BR>This is the fourth book of the Power Classes series from Mongoose
Publishing. Designed to be seamlessly slotted into any fantasy-based d20
system game, each of these mini-supplements introduce an entirely new core
character class, adding a whole new dimension to campaigns. Players will find
full details on how to use the new character class, greatly increasing the
wealth of options they are presented with by the core rulebooks while Games
Masters may revel in the wide variety of new classes they have at their
disposal for non-player characters in their campaigns. Each Power Class
booklet can provide hours of gaming enjoyment at an all new low cost.<BR><BR><b>
