Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
For the past few years, an ogre that lairs in a cave near the wilderness
town of Dundraville has demanded tributes of ale and supplies. The villagers
were happy to comply, lest the brute attack them or destroy their property.
But recently, the ogre changed his demands. Now he wants gold, building
supplies - and captives! When the ogre walked into town only to have his
request denied, he flew into a rage. The brute dragged two townsfolk off
to his cave, to be eaten for sure! The villagers have no heroes to protect
them - so someone must rise to the challenge! Six determined townsfolk
have taken decided to take justice into their own hands. Can these village
commoners defeat the ogre in his own lair before their fellows are eaten?<BR><BR>
If you enjoy this adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl
Classics series!
