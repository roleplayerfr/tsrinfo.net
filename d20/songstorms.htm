<center><b>Storm Warnings!</b></center><BR>Without warning, a mysterious
and deadly storm rolls in from the horizon, mercilessly striking the
peaceful fishing village of Thrund. Clearly unnatural in origin, the
terrifying storm seems directed by some malignant will, and rumors
spread like wildfire, speaking of an ancient curse resurrected, a curse
whose origins lie more than five hundred years in the past.<BR><BR>You
have only a few days to unravel the tangled skein of rumor and legend in
order to piece together the source of this unnatural storm, for as each
night passes, the storm grows stronger and stronger, threatening to
bring the village crashing into the sea. Can you discover the source
of this storm, and find a way to stop it, this time forever?<BR><BR>Song
of Storms is the first adventure to take place in the wild, dangerous
region known as the Stormlands. Song of Storms takes the heroes into
the heart of the Stormlands, a land where the Old Ways clash with the
new, where the gods still walk the land and involve themselves with the
affairs of mortals, and where the land itself can be the greatest enemy
of all.
