Deep within their mountain<BR>fortresses, the dwarves toil away at
their<BR>craft, turning precious ore into works of<BR>priceless beauty.
Yet these are nor mere artisans, for<BR>they are the masters of yet
another skill: the art of warfare.<BR>For every gold coin that flows
into the halls of the dwarven<BR>lords, there stands at the ready a
grim-faced dwarven warrior<BR>prepared to defend it with his very
life.<BR><BR>Each HEROES OF HIGH FAVOR book contains a toolkit of
additional<BR>feats, skills, concepts, and prestige classes to explore
your race's favored<BR>class. DWARVES features background information
and role-playing tips<BR>for ten unique dwarven prestige classes, as
well as new feats, fighting<BR>styles, and dwarven runes. You will
also find an extensive section on<BR>dwarven craftsmanship, including
weapon and armorsmithing rules.<BR>You can create entirely news kinds
of masterwork weapons and<BR>armor, crafted from the finest dwarven
steel, mithral, and<BR>adamantine.<BR><BR>HEROES OF HIGH FAVOR: DWARVES
is the<BR>definitive sourcebook for dwarven<BR>characters of every
kind.</center>
