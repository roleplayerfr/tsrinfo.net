The lizardfolk of Hssith were once a primitive people, foraging and
hunting for their daily fare beneath the watchful eye of their patron -
the Sun God. They lived in thatched villages, huddled so closely that
other more civilized societies would call it a city.<BR><BR>But when the
earth shook and the mountains slid into the river, their lives changed
forever.<BR><BR>Deep beneath the mountains on the edge of Hssith swamp,
thick, muddied water consumed a dark elf city. All the vaunted magic
of the people was not enough to halt the cataclysm. The mountain fell
and the city flooded.<BR><BR>Bearing little more than their precious
libraries, the dark elves rose and swore to unearth their fallen city.
Until then, however, the elves would have to make due.<BR><BR>Hssith,
now called Hosuth, is a swamp city of lizardfolk enslaved by dark elves.
The stagnant cityscape reflects a primitive civilization oppressed by
higher intellect - a race of slaves laboring under the iron fist of
tyrannical masters. The city is open to traders, merchants of all races,
and adventurers that seek to steal the prizes buried in the lost city
below the new-made lake. But beware. You are not the only ones who seek
to uncover what has been lost...
