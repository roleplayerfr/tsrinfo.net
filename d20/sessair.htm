<center><b>The Tribe That Stands Up</b></center><BR>The Sessair are the most
battle-crazed of all the Tribes of the Earth Goddess. They are renowed for
their eagerness to go to war - even without provocation - simply because they
like to fight. However, they are not generally interested in conquest or
rulership of other tribes for they value freedom above all else and barely
tolerate the ambitions of their own Kings, let alone those of any hypothetical
High King. Thus it is rare to find them pressing their advantage - they could
probably conquer the whole of Tir Nan Og if they could be motivated to do so,
but are likely to stop for a feast as soon as they have plundered a barrel of
ale or caludron of mead.<BR><BR><center><b>Inside You Will Find:</b></center><BR>
