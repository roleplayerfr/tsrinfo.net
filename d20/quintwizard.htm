<center>The wise old sage, stooped and walking with a staff, good-natured
and kindly yet terrifying if angered. The lean, wily battle wizard,
festooned with bandoliers of magical throwing daggers and wands. The
tribal magician, feathered rattle in hand, tatoos shimmering with
magical force. The vile necromancer, lurking in his subterranean lair,
plotting to rule the land. All these are examples of the wizard, the
character class without which no game could be considered high fantasy.
The Quintessential Wizard is a sourcebook that will greatly expand the
class, fleshing out the wizard from his typical role as a source of
magical artillery to a character with more options and variants than
any other in the game.<BR><BR>Of all the character classes depicted
within the d20 system, the wizard is the most versatile. With
reasonably comprehensive spellbooks, the wizard can be more dangerous
than the fighter, more sneaky than the rogue, or a better all-rounder
than the cleric. Responsibility for success and even survival of the
entire party often rests on the wizard's shoulders - if he wastes a
spell or memorizes the wrong one, disaster can ensue for the whole
group, whereas by selecting just the right spell at just the right time
he can deal with almost any situation successfully, however dire.<BR><BR><b>
