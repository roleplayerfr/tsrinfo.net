Noribund, Commandant-Burgher of Vallidyl, paced nervously around the
empty council chambers in the city garrison. "I'm surprised you're not
worried," he told his daughter, who draped herself over one of the
tall-backed chairs reserved for other burghers. "I haven't seen Jasper
for days."<BR><BR>"Dad, it's just a stupid cat. I'm a grown-up girl
now. I'm done playing with dolls and silly pets. I wish I had more
responsibility, like you."<BR><BR>"Running this city and defending it
from outside threats is no work for a young lady like you, Carnelia."<BR><BR>
"Just forget about it." Carnelia heaved herself out of the chair and
stomped out of the council chambers.<BR><BR>Noribund stroked his beard,
mumbling to himself. He suddenly stopped pacing and called out for
his clerk. "Benthric! Visit the taverns and hire some competent
mercenaries."<BR><BR>"But sir, the guard has reached full capacity, the
barracks are crowded, and we have no more equipment for new recruits."<BR><BR>
"I want them to find our cat. Jasper's just as much a part of my
family as Carnelia. We would all be crushed if something terrible
happened to him," Noribund said, wringing his hands. "Offer these
people 200 gold up front and another 800 gold when they return Jasper
alive. He's a brownish tabby with a bit of a paunch. A silver
tinkling bell hangs from a silk collar around his neck."<BR><BR>"That
should be sufficient, sir," Benthric began sneaking off. "I'll make
the necessary arrangements, and see that your adventurers begin their
search for poor Jasper as soon as possible."
