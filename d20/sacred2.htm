these four sacred sanctuaries. <i>Sacred Ground 2</i> presents four more
holy sites to use as PC home bases, as settings for your next adventure, or
as lairs for your characters' most powerful enemies. Each entry provides
location maps and fortifications, NPC stats and backgrounds, and plot
ideas to bring the site to life.<BR><BR>This plug-and-play sourcebook
includes:<BR><BR><ul><li>HAI SHEN GONG: A vibrantly colorful Middle
Kingdom temple sits atop a wind-blasted cliff overlooking the crashing
waves of the dark sea below. The head prietess personally attends to the
fiery beacon that warns ships away from the dangerous shoals... and from
the sacred creatures hidden within the cliff itself.</ul><ul><li>CRÈCHE
HOSPICE: A small country estate houses an unfinished temple complex and the
headquarters of the Crèche Knights. The hospice is pilgrimage site,
hospital, garrison, and inn all at once, but also a prison for an entity
called the Blasphemer, which prophesies that other creatures like itself
will soon rise to plunge the religions of the world into chaos.</ul><ul><li>
THE ORACLE: This ancient mountain tower is kept by mystics dedicated to
the Lady of Fate, and is home to the goddess's oracle. At the request of
supplicants, this young girl can plumb the depths of history and unravel
the threads of destiny itself.</ul><ul><li>EARTHBLOOD GROVE: On the edges
of civilization is an old-growth stand of hardwood trees with the
reputation of being haunted and filled with strange fey creatures. Those
concerned with such things know the secret of the forest: it is a druidic
grove with a powerful natural relic hidden in its heart.</ul><center>
