In the Aruun Jungle, children turn against their parents and the plants and
bodiless spirits haunt ancient ruins.<BR><BR>In the havens of the Miransil and
the clanholds of the dwarves, not all are as they seem.<BR><BR>In the barren
Northlands, the earth and sky alike hunger for human blood.<BR><BR>And in
the strongholds of the Shadow, new and terrible foes are bred from foul
rituals and dark magics.<BR><BR>Welcome to Eredane, a land under Shadow.
The creatures herein may fill many roles, from the natural animals of
Eredane's ecosystem to the most vicious hunters under Izrador's command.
They range from minor annoyances and tricksters to powerful beings that
even the Night Kings fear. Also included are stat blocks and background
for several of Izrador's most notorious servants: Grial the Fey Killer,
Zebrim the Slayer, Darshod of the Dead Mother Tribe, and more. Whether
you need more creatures to pit against your heroes on Aryth, or you want
to bring the taste of MIDNIGHT to another campaign, the MINIONS OF THE
SHADOW are ready to serve.<BR><BR><center>Requires the use of the Dungeons
