<center>For centuries, the cult of Mitra was the only religion allowed in
Aquilonia - all others forbidden by edict of the crown. However, the ascension
of King Conan to the Aquilonian throne changed all that. Not only was Conan
himself a worshipper of Crom, but his barbarian temperament could not abide the
prospect of persecution of others simply because of the gods they chose to
follow. After witnessing one act of religious intolerance after another, King
Conan decreed that every man in his realm be free to worship whatever god he
may chose.<BR><BR>King Conan 's edict was the subject of strident opposition.
Many, throughout Aquilonia, feared that allowing Hyboria's other religions to
openly exist within the borders of the country would ultimately destroy it,
diluting its most powerful unifying force - religion.<BR><BR>Several years have
passed since King Conan's edict and thus far Aquilonia has not unravelled.
Still, a burning, fervent need to stop the potential spread of other religions
and save Aquilonia from the mad edicts of the barbarian king has prevailed. Now
a band of zealous priests have turned to their sacred texts, seeking answers
and justifications and, in the name of piety, have stripped the words of
context and intent, finding within their sacred passages, intended to promote
peace, civilisation and forgiveness, rationalisations for the embracing of sin,
darkness and violence in the name of the greater good.<BR><BR>Heretics of Tarantia
is a scenario of a different breed. Designed for four to six Player Characters
of between 5<sup><font size="-1">th</font></sup> and 7<sup><font size="-1">th</font></sup>
character level, this adventure combines situations and encounters that will
require a wide range of skills to survive and overcome as Player Characters
become embroiled in a story of intrigue, treachery, politics and murder in the
most glorious city of the West.</center>
