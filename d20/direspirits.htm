<center><b>THE JUNGLE IS AWAKE</b></center><BR>The fearsome bounty hunter KanUk -
a kosan orc from the Mythical Ages of Nyambe-tanda - was long ago bound into the
body of an undead dire lion. His savagery knew no bounds among the helpless
slaves of his land until he was defeated in the Great Rebellion, and his spirit
was shunted into his own still-beating undead heart. This heart has rested
undisturbed in a foul shrine for thousands of years, protected by magical wards
erected by the kosans before they fled. But not even kosan magic is eternal,
and just over a month ago, the wards collapsed, exposing the shrine to the
world outside.<BR><BR>When this malignant heart begins to assemble animal slaves
intent on locating a new body for their evil master, a group of brave warriors
must find and destroy it before it orchestrates KanUk's rebirth, and all of
Nyambe-tanda falls beneath his claws!<BR><BR><i>Dire Spirits</i> is a D20 System
adventure for 1st level characters. It provides an introduction to the

Mounchili, a typical community in the Empire of Mabwe, that can become the PCs'
base in a larger campaign.</ul><ul><li>Maps and descriptions of the ancient
temple that contains KanUk's still-beating heart.</ul><ul><li>Pregenerated PCs
and stats for agogwe halfling warriors, wakyambi elf adepts, and Nghoi human
