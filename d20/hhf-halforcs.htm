the orphans of savage wars, drifting back into the territories of yet-unconquered
people, a reminder of the constant struggle against the forces of chaos.
Shunned by humanity, the half-orcs have learned to survive on their own, through
savage barbarism: What is not freely given must be taken by force. The
half-orc does not seek pity nor compassion, but fear and respect.<BR><BR>Each
HEROES OF HIGH FAVOR book contains a toolkit of additional feats, skills,
concepts, and prestige classes to explore your face's favored class. HALF-ORCS
features background information and role-playing tips for ten unique half-orc
prestige classes, as well as new feats and new uses for old skills specific
to barbarians. New Craftsmanship rules detail savage weapons and armor as well
as quick-and-dirty "shoddy craftsmanship," so you can arm your horde in a
hurry. New Handle Animal rules allow comprehensive (yet simple) cross-breeding
of fantastic guardian beasts, and you'll find additional uses for your
Intimidate and Wilderness Lore skills as well.<BR><BR>HEROES OF HIGH FAVOR:
HALF-ORCS is the definitive sourcebook for half-orc characters of every
king.<BR><BR><center>Requires the use of the Dungeons and Dragons <a href="../3e/phb.htm">
