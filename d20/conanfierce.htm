RED MEAT AND STINGING WINE ON MY PALATE, THE HOT EMBRACE OF WHITE ARMS, THE
MAD EXULTATION OF BATTLE WHEN THE BLUE BLADES FLAME AND CRIMSON, AND I AM
CONTENT. LET TEACHERS AND PRIESTS AND PHILOSOPHERS BROOD OVER QUESTIONS OF
REALITY AND ILLUSION. I KNOW THIS: IF LIFE IS ILLUSION, THEN I AM NO LESS
AN ILLUSION, AND BEING THUS, THE ILLUSION IS REAL TO ME. I LIVE, I BURN
WITH LIFE, I LOVE, I SLAY, AND AM CONTENT.</b><BR><BR>The Hyborian Age is
a world of heartless and brutal violence. In this dark world stalk
equally violent, heartless and brutal warriors. Many are little more
than bandits and murderers while others tread a more noble and honourable
path, but all of them ferocious and enduring, able to deal out death as
quickly as the world around them.<BR><BR>The fierce are those hardy
characters who stand tall against the world and look it straight in the
eye, assured, as they are, of their own ability. The fierce are the nomad
horde; a living sandstorm stripping the civilised of their flesh, leaving
nothing in their wake but death. The fierce are the barbarians that
strike low the cities of civilised Hyborian lands with the surety of an
earthquake. The fierce are borderers that strike with the deadly precision
of a hurricane carried on wings of silent death. Powered only by their
confidence, courage and wits, the barbarians, borderers and nomads of the
Hyborian Age are the epitome of vibrant life, fuelled by their eagerness
to bring down the walls and gates of civilisation. These people are the
embodiments of chaos and destruction that will watch Hyboria burn as they
plunder the wealth of ages, revelling in blood and gore as they drive
through the chaff of humanity.<BR><BR>This book discusses how the various
cultures of Conan's age look at the barbarian, borderer and nomad classes.
Giving advice on those skills and feats which emphasise each culture's
iconic interpretations of those three classes, revealing the secrets of
Hyboria's Fiercest. Including information, tips and rules for exerting
one's body to its utmost limit at a price to health and soul, the secrets
of survival, camouflage, equipment and hunting, and a plethora of new
combat styles and manoeuvres, this book allows you create entirely new
and individual barbarians, borderers and nomads.</center>
