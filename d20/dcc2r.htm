Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
A simple expedition to rid a village of a
maruading ogre soon becomes more than it seems. A mysterious force has
transformed the ogre and the kobold tribe he once bullied into twisted,
demented creatures. When the characters enter the ogre's cave, they find a
passage behind leading deep into the mountains. Soon they arrive at the lost
vault of the sorcerer Tsathzar Rho, where they are confronted with the
terrifying dangers of a lost epoch!<BR><BR>If you enjoy this
adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl Classics series!
