<center><b>Danse Macabre</b></center><BR><i>"A stately procession circled
the great hall, presenting themselves to the lords of the castle. We
were transfixed by the dancers, and by the grim truth shared by all of
them, Everyone in the hall was dead! They had sword wounds and axe
cuts and burns. At the high table, the king had the blackened face of
a poisoned man. Even in their deaths, they were beautiful - even in
their deaths, they danced.<BR><BR>"...And a strange compulsion rose from
the floor into our feet, and we stepped down into the hall, and we
joined the pavane and danced toward the king."<BR><BR></i>A millenium
ago, the kingdom of Dayvos fell in a single night to an act of magical
treachery. Tonight, the echoes of that powerful spell have drawn you
into its last hours. If you are quick-witted and light-footed, you can
free the souls of the imprisoned dancers or even change history. If you
fail, you will dance among the dead forever!<BR><BR><i>The Last Dance</i>
is a D20 fantasy adventure module that features:<BR><BR>An unearthly
journey into a time-forgotten woods warped by magic, where the only
escape is in uncovering the dark conspiracy of an age past.<BR><BR>New
