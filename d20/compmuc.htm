<b>It's Not Easy Being... Undead!</b><BR>There comes a time in every
adventurer's life when he faces the pure, unadulterated evil of undeath.
Some are able to overcome their fears to face that evil unflinchingly, while
others flee in terror. But not all of those that are able to stand up
against that evil survive. So what happens to those heroes slain by the
undead? If they're lucky, their friends cremate them, powder their bones
and sprinkle holy water over their ashes before scattering them to the
winds. But when they don't, the slain hero must suddenly cope with the
knowledge that what he does in undeath is evil beyond measure.<BR><BR><b>
Think You Know How to Beat These Baddies?</b><BR>A skeleton is a skeleton
and a ghost is a ghost, right? Not anymore. Many undead creatures are
unthinking, unfeeling abominations whose only purposes are to kill and
consume the living. But some are super-intelligent beings, powerful
beyond words, with nothing short of complete domination as their goals.
Every one of these creatures is unique, with their own powers and their
own innate abilities. With this book in your hands, you won't have to use
those stock creatures any more!<BR><BR><b>New Experiences for a New
Generation!</b><BR>Whether you're a new player or someone who's been
role-playing for decades, this book has something for you. Some will want
to take on the challenge of playing the undead, while others will
immediately take to eradicating the evil plague of undeath. Either way,
prepare for the kind of campaign you've never experienced before!<BR><BR>
