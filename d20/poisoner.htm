<b>A Deadly Touch...</b><BR><BR>Poisons exist in abundance in fantasy worlds,
their deadly touch waiting within ancient traps, slathered upon readied weapons,
or pooling within a fanged and monstrous maw. Some poisons are magical creations,
concocted by dark powers in secret laboratories. Other toxins are naturally
occurring on many worlds across the planes. Still other venoms drip from the
fangs and scales of fearsome beasts.<BR><BR><b>A Warm Embrace</b><BR><BR><i><b>
Pale Designs: A Poisoner's Handbook</b></i> presents a comprehensive collection
of poisons (from numerous Open Content products, as well as new creations) for
use by both players and Game Masters. New rules for handling poisons in a
campaign are presented, along with additional options to allow heroes safer
access to poisons. There are also new prestige classes, equipment, and magic
items for assassins and others interested in poison use.<BR><BR><i><b>Pale
Designs: A Poisoner's Handbook</b></i> requires the use of the <b>Dungeons &
