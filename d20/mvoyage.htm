<center><b>HORROR ON THE HIGH SEAS</b></center><BR>There's a tale you
hear in a tavern by the docks, if you catch an old sea dog on a dark
night laden with rum. He'll tell you of an all but forgotten sea god
with a hatred for the living and their ships that so brazenly cross
his waters without offering the blood sacrifice he demanded in the days
of yore. The god's powers have waned, as brave sailors of all the
races bravely cast off in search of far horizons and treasures to fill
their holds, but on the darkest of days his might returns. The grizzled
sailor may have known someone who set sail on the <i>Sea Maiden</i>,
just before such a day three decades ago, and never returned. Others
may tell you that the crew of the <i>Sea Maiden</i> was restless, and
mutiny was in the air; the crew no doubt ended up hanged as pirates in
a distant port. But your storyteller assures you he knows better: the
dark god of the sea had his vengeance - and he will have it again one
day soon.<BR><BR><i>Maiden Voyage</i> features:<BR><BR>A plot easily
