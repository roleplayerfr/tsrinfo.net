of evil, the creatures that make up the hordes of darkness that
threaten to overwhelm the good peoples and turn the entire land into a
region of little else than slaughter and depravity. Most Games Masters

above kobolds as a threat. Often they are simply portrayed as evil
humans and are given little more thought than that.<BR><BR><b>Inside

often brutal and short there's more to them than meets the eye<BR><BR>

are geared towards warfare<BR><BR><b>Methods of Warfare:</b> There are

gods for combat.<BR><BR><b>Scenario Hooks:</b> A selection of ideas on
