The iron fist of the Shadow squeezes Eredane dry. In cities across the
continent, whole wards are purged of innocents at the whim of dark priests
and bloodthirsty orc commanders. But in one city, the residents merely
wear the guise of innocence. In one city, the body may be broken but the
soul is still strong. Welcome to Baden's Bluff.<BR><BR>This sourcebook for
the city of Baden's Bluff contains a wealth of setting material for DMs,
describing a city that is both a place of refuge and one of adventure.
Its dark streets can be as dangerous to legates and orcs as they are to
resistance fighters, and many secrets lie among its worm-eaten docks,
forgotten sewers, and ancient canals. Players will find new organizations
to join and feats designed to bring the fight to the dark god. Baden's
Bluff is an ember of hope as well as a culling ground, for all those who
try to survive UNDER THE SHADOW.<BR><BR><ul><li>Dozens of organizations,
NPCs, and location descriptions.<li>Maps, adventure hooks, and local
rumors to incorporate into any MIDNIGHT campaign.<li>An overview of the
lands around Baden's Bluff and how they are used by the factions within
the city.<li>Terrifying new opponents created by Sunulael himself, and
the feats and prestige class with which the Badens fight them.</ul><BR><center>
