<center>d20 Sourcebook<BR>Requires the use of the Dungeons & Dragons Third Edition
core Books, published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.<BR><BR><b>Bristling With
Possibilities</b><BR>Cities and Settlements is packed with timeless material.
The designers, led by Jeff Ibach, present nineteen seperate settings. The settings
comprise a wide variety of settlements and cities; wilderness, desert maps, orc
strongholds, gnoll camps, dwarven halls and human villages.<BR>This is a
sourcebook that both players and game masters can use. Complete with maps and
illustrations, Cities and Settlements is the definitive sourcebook for game
settings. Each community is an officially sized Thorp, Hamlet, Village or Small
Town complete with stat blocks conforming to the rules presented in the updated
rules along with a full history and background with notes on customs, laws,
religion, and more. Each presents a different interesting culture: NPC's
bristling with interactive possibilities, plots and adventure hooks and offers
new d20 crunchy bits to add to your game as well, from prestige classes to
poisons, spells to new monsters.<BR><BR><b>For Any Campaign</b><BR>This useful
sourcebook can be used for well structured homebrew campaigns or for those on
the moment, fly by the seat of your pants escapades into a night's round of
iron and blood. The enterprising players will find a host of background
material to flesh out those skeletal character histories and add a world of
depth to their play.</center>
