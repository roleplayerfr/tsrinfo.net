<center>This book is the definitive guide to the world of Magnamund and the many
roleplaying possibilities it provides. here you will find the Brotherhood
of the Crystal Star before their order went into seclusion. You can ride
with the Sommerlund Knights of the Realm five decades before their fateful
charge against the Darklord Zagarna decimated their numbers. You can walk
the forests of the Wild-Lands with Telchos Amazons, alert for any danger
that might leap out of the toua trees. If you can imagine an adventure,
it awaits you somewhere on the face (or in the dark caverns) of
Magnamund.<BR><BR>Discover how to create Kai Lords of your own, wield
their immense supernatural disciplines in battle and take up arms against
the seemingly endless hordes of darkness that plague the land. You will
find the many spells of the Crystal Star lexicons, the magic of the Dessi
and the wild spiritualism of the Telchoi and see for yourself how very
different they are. The wisdom of many races both old and new will be
at your command, making the stories you wish to tell in your campaigns
more compelling and detailed. From psychic combat to the searing force of
elementalism, you will have all the power you need to do battle against
the night and defend whichever kingdom you proudly call home.<BR><BR>Lone
Wolf, The Roleplaying Game is an entire sourcebook and roleplaying game
encompassed within a single tome. Every rule and roleplaying suggestion
is included in the spirit of the original Lone Wolf series, updated to
OGL rules and expanded to incorporate both North and South Magnamund.<BR><BR>
Over 100 pages are dedicated to the Gazetteer and Bestiary sections, with
detailed descriptions of the many realms, races and monsters that make up
Magnamund. Notes on cultures, encounters and the inevitable dangers of
the land will be at your fingertips. Want to travel into the Jungle of
Horrors? This guide will let you know what plants are edible and which
ones might try to eat you instead and discover why you should stock up on
your laumspur potions before taking a trip to Ruel. Statistics for dozens
of terrible beasts and vile henchmen are given, to throw at those foolish
enough to oppose the rise of the Darklords. From skulking Giaks to the
raging might of the Mawtaw, these foes will pose quite a challenge for
anyone determined to play hero in a world destined to fall before the
might of Helgedad and its shadowy forces.</center>
