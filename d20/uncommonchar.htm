<center><b>VILLAINOUS. VALOROUS. VERSATILE.</b></center><BR>Within this book
await villainous, noble, and not-so-noble characters alike - fascinating
personalities designed to spark adventures large and small. Here you'll find a
half-fey bard with a heavenly voice and a veiled face; an exiled paladin gatering
allies to reclaim his heritage; the daughter of a celestial, who is tempted by
a "friendly" imp; and a gnome illusionist who thinks he's a solidified mirror
image - and may be right.<BR><BR>Each character comes with adventure seeds to
broaden the horizons of any fantasy world, along with new feats, spells, items,
prestige classes, and more, all ready to be added to your campaign.<BR><BR>

detailed histories and descriptions including complete D20 Sytem stats, all
ready to be introduced into a campaign at a moment's notice. Plus familiars,
mounts, companions, and even an aquatic paladin's war-eel!</ul><ul><li>Over 100
adventure seeds linked to specific NPCs.</ul><ul><li>New magic items and artifacts
like the <i>rib cage</i> and the <i>iron skull of Brodan</i>; new spells like
<i>control mirror image</i> and <i>Bezum's beacon</i>; new monsters like the
cackle dead; new feats like Rally, Dextrous Grapple, and Strange Luck; new
deities worshipped by ogres, nixies, and humans; new prestige classes like soul

beyond the bounds of human society.</ul><ul><li>A quick-reference index of D20
material, and NPC lists arranged by Challenge Rating, alphabetically, by race,
by class, and by alignment to make finding a suitable NPC or your favorite
crunchy bits fast and easy.</ul><center>Requires the use of the Dungeons &
