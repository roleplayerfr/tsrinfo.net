Whether by luck or by the hands of your dark lord, you have finally
tracked down the location of the sacred dagger. With the blade, you can
finally summon the demon R'Godae to this world and claim him as your
vassal. If you believe the tales, and you see no reason to doubt them,
R'Godae will be at your beck and call, forced into servitude in exchange
for an end to the curse that banished him.<BR><BR>Of course, claiming
the dagger won't be easy. According to your information, the weapon
was once the possession of the wizard Folnar, a champion of justice and
a bitter enemy of darkness. The dagger now rests within what was once
his home, a place dedicated to training wizards and warriors who follow
in Folnar's heroic steps. Striking there not only claims you the dagger,
but also deals a grievous blow to the forces of good, ending the
careers of some of its most promising young champions.
