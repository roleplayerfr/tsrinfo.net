You can scarcely credit what your senses tell you. You see, spread out
for hundreds of yards on either side of the main road, a huge, sprawling
camp bustling with people. It appears to be a village, except that no
maps tell of any settlement for miles around, and besides, villagers
don't usually live in weather-beaten tents made of stitched hide. You
hear a lute being strummed, a high, sweet voice singing, and an unusually
clear ring of hammer against anvil - all of this cutting through the
braying of animals being herded toward the long grass outside the camp.
A rich scent of cooking food, unlike anything you have smelled before,
wafts toward you on the breeze. Then, suddenly and without cause, a
burst of bright color lights up the sky, accompanied by a piercing,
gleeful cackle.<BR><BR>What is this place? Who are these people?<BR><BR>
As you reach the outskirts of the camp, a burly guard with a sharp
longsword dangling at his side steps in front of you. He holds up his
hand and looks you up and down. Then he smiles, but there is a flinty
look in his eye. "Welcome to Azul," he says. "We have two rules here:
stay out of trouble, and don't close your purse strings too tightly.
Follow them, and you'll have a fine time."
