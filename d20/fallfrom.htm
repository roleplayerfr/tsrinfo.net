In the nation's darkest hour arises a new hope: a messiah-paladin, the
prophesied God-King. Protecting the weak and low of station even as
he defends the nation against invaders and corrupt statesmen alike, the
God-King's ascension to the throne of Lutan promises to herald a new
age of peave and prosperity for all his subjects.<BR><BR>But peace and
prosperity have never been profitable and many contest the rise of the
God-King. Deposed royalty, foreign invaders, and corrupt merchants
all find in him a mutual foe. Though the God-King's armies are mighty,
many believe that a few assassins can succeed where the legions of
darkness have failed. All the while others conspire to make the God-King
their own. Every brigand, cutthroat, and assassin in the realm turns
an eye to Lutan and to a quick, bloody profit.
