<center><b>THE WORLD IS ENTERING AN AGE OF IRON, AN AGE OF WAR AND
IMPERIALISTIC AMBITION; SOME STRONG MAN MIGHT DO WELL SHOULD HE RISE ABOVE
THE RUINS OF NATIONS AS A SUPREME CONQUEROR. FOR SELDOM DO WE RUINED MEN
KNOW WHAT IS GOOD FOR US; ALWAYS ARE WE BESET WITH DOUBTS AND FEARS. WE
ARE SO LOWLY THAT RARELY CAN WE DISCERN OUR OWN PATH. ONLY THE FINEST CAN
SET OUR FEET UPON THE PATH TO PARADISE.</b><BR><BR>The Hyborian Age is a
world of courts and kings, war and wealth, power and corruption. Yet in
this grim world of discipline and deceit nobles, scholars and soldiers
revel and excel. Nobles wield wealth and influence, treading the jewelled
thrones of the land, hovering around the perfumed courts and palaces of
the Hyborian Age like flies around a carcass. Scholars master knowledge
and alchemy as they delve deep into books and tombs, seeking answers to
riddles most men shudder to even think of. Soldiers are the lords of the
battlefield, mastering their weapons to a degree few can ever hope to
attain.<BR><BR>Each has their arena of expertise; each a specialist in
their field and yet they are commonly uncomfortable and ineffective
outside of them.<BR><BR>The fine are those elevated characters, raised
above the common man, who inspire such men to greatness or crush these
humble souls beneath their heel.<BR><BR>This book dicusses how the various
cultures of Conan's age look at the noble, scholar and soldier classes.
Giving advice on those skills and feats that emphasise each culture's
iconic interpretations of those three classes, revealing the secrets of
Hyboria's Finest. Including information, tips and rules, including new
regional features and social abilities spells and arcane items, and a
plethora of new combat styles and manoeuvres, this book lets you create
entirely individual nobles, scholars and soldiers.</center>
