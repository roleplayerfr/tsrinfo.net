<center><b>Bring Me Her Carcass!</b></center><BR>Welcome to the Magic
Dump, but please be careful. All may not be what you'd expect. After
all, the monsters here steal church furniture, while the frogs explode.
Alligators come with four heads, and innocent little birds turn
ferocious.<BR><BR>Please don't try to keep the people living in the
cemetary buried. They have lots of room to share and are only looking
for new friends - like you. Meanwhile the bellows you hear come from
a creature named "Mittens;" a creature that would be happy to have you
for lunch.<BR><BR>Other than that, the Magic Dump is just like any other
place that contains a pile of magic items that nobody wants.<BR><BR>
Against the panorama of this strange and forbidding region is Greeley,
the enigmatic Prime of Harwich. He is storming around his castle
bellowing "Bring me her carcass" every time someone mentions his
bride-to-be. Ianthe' has gone missing and is apparently inside the
swamp. His desire for her is so strong that he's offering 50,000 gold
pieces for anyone brave enough to bring her back. Their wedding was
supposed to end an ages old war.<BR><BR>He wants her, but why is the
wanted poster so crudely worded? Is the Prime mad, in either sense of
the word, or does he have something else in mind for his fiancée?<BR><BR>
Ask yourself which is stranger, the kingdom or its swamp?<BR><BR>The
Magic Dump is an outdoor module for a party of 6th to 8th level
adventurers. Staged in the swamp, it is also a partial maze featuring a
myriad of new magic items and original creatures.
