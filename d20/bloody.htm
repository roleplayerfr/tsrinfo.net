<i>...it is a matter which will bring trouble to the people of Sicaris.
It may even bring war to the whole of the Hinterlands. The order has
been given to judge the accused in the ancient Hinterland tradition of
trial by combat.</i><BR><BR><b>-Sylab<BR>Shadow Prince of Sicaris</b><BR><BR>
The petty and traitorous schemes of a distant Hinterland commander
strike at the very heart of the Coryani. Rumors of collaboration with
the dismal, gloomy powers of Canceri send the Imperial council into a
panic, and the brink of war looms again over an uncertain future for
the peoples of the Imperium. Thrust into the intrigues of mighty
nations and the sinister plans of the far flung cities of foreign lands,
the players go in secret with an Imperial legate on a task of direst
importance to the ancient outpost of Sicaris. The mission is twofold:
To bring back a wayward noble daughter of the Imperial family of
val'Assante', and to find the source of the turmoil that seeks to tip
the teetering balance of power. These objectives will lead the heroes
into a shadow war of sinister alliances, secretive cabals, assassins,
spies, and unfolding machinations, a twisting path that may lead to
both theirs and the Empire's salvation, or its' downfall.<BR><BR><b>
