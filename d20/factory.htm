<center><b>I, ROBOT.<BR>YOU, WORMFOOD!</b></center><BR>You, too, can make this
threat if you're an 8' tall, mithrium endoskeleton wrapped in 3-inch thick
adamantium plates and sporting 360 degree vision, deflector screens, and turbo
motivators while bringing a 15d8 delayed blast fireball online.<BR>The arcane
science of technomagic once again yields a terrifying crop: magical computers,
robots, and dweonetics. From not-so-innocent beginings as golems, the long
history of technomagical development has resulted in the magical robot! To
control these automatons demanded the invention of the arcane computer. From
there it was but a short leap to melding magical machine and man with
dweonetics - arcan cybernetic devices implanted directly into living subjects!<BR><BR>

characters</b> using the <b>7</b> character robot models (domestic, service,
sports, security, industrial, military and companion) and more than <b>200</b>
robot upgrades.<BR><BR><b>Mix</b> man and magical machine with over <b>200</b>
dweonetic items, from adrenal stimulators, aural masks, and dermal weaves to
faithguards, flux generators, hidden blades, muscle grafts, and visual

<b>200</b> robot upgrades to create a nearly limitless assortment of unique
magical machines!<BR><BR><b>Design</b> your own powered battlesuit from <b>5</b>

effects of dweonetic surgery mishaps, such as arcane psychosis and ethereotic
seizure!<BR><BR><b>Fear</b> the <b>3</b> new creature templates: robotic,
dweoborg, and ethereotic!<BR><BR><b>Battle</b> for your life against more than
<b>12</b> specific robots!<BR><BR><b>Wreak havoc</b> in <b>7</b> pre-designed
