An ancient, defiled sword, long ago bestowed by the gods of light, must
be reconsecrated after spending generations within the confines of an
evil temple. The divine once again turn their eyes towards the mortal
realm when an evil goddess threatens to send her demon beast to the
middle world. The gods know the currents of fate and the conflict this
action will bring. Fate has decided there will again be a Gods War. Is
now the time? Fate has also chosen the characters to be the nexus for
this battle between light and darkness. Will they accept the lot given
them, or forge a path of their own?<BR><BR>This challenging campaign
supplement is designed for a party of four to six characters of level 7-10.
Acceptance of Fate is the climactic finale for 'Unto this End' - a trilogy
of adventures set in the dark fantasy d20 campaign setting of Diomin.
Herein, GMs will find not only a thrilling adventure to challenge their
players, but also the secrets of the mystical science of Mecheidolon, or
Spirit Tech, a new fanatical assassin cult, new feats, new spells, a new
demon and a new template for characters chosen by gods.
