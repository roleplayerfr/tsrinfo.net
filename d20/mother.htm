<center><b>One Table to Rule Them All!</b><BR>The Mother of All Encounter
Tables is here! This utility is unlike any before conceived! This is not
just a random book of tables, but a well thought out DM utility that will
make wilderness travel, city streets and dungeon corridors all more
interesting. It contains encounters for each terrain type from mountains
to ocean, in each climate from arctic to tropical, and has seperate tables
for day and night encounters, with space left for the DM to insert new
monsters of his choosing. In addition to encounters with monsters and
men, there are tables for unusual weather events, strange occurences,
accidents, and encounters with NPCs. Trade routes and caravans are
detailed as well as trolls and dragons. After all, you never know when
ants will infest your food, or when the cleric will be struck by
lightning!</center>
