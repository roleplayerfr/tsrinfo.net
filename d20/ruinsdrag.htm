<center><b>THIS BOX HOLDS A TERRIBLE SECRET</b><BR>The ancient Athan
civilisation, which worshipped evil dragons and demonic entities, disappeared
many centuries ago in the depths of the hollow peak known only as
Mount Moru. For countless ages, the history of this ruined civilisation
and their forgotten dragon cult remained untold, except for three old
tomes of unknown origin...<BR><BR><b>THE PATH OF ARCHANEROTH</b><BR>Rumour
speaks of a detailed map of Mount Moru and its inner caves, allegedly
based on the findings of countless explorers and adventurers, as well as
merchant and diplomatic reports obtained from contact with its few
peaceful inhabitants. An anonymous hand gathered, organised and
transcribed this evidence under the title The Path of the Archaneroth.
Now, for the first time, the compilation is published in the form of a
full dungeon, ready for adventurers to enter and seek out its dangers...<BR><BR>
<b>THE DRAGON STONE</b><BR>There exists a wealth of information about
Mount Moru, its geography and history, including reports from many
sources, from ancient folktales to actual testimonies taken direct from
local people. This compilation, given the name of The Dragon Stone,
is a complete guide to the times and places of the Athan civilisation and
the Mount Moru area, equally useful for adventurers, researchers or
casual visitors.<BR><BR><b>TALES OF MOUNT MORU</b><BR>This book is a
collection of stories, facts and reports about both ancient legends and
recent events located in Mount Moru. It is unknown whether these Tales
are fact or fancy; they are probably a little of both. They are reunited
here for a Games Master to narrate them as seperate adventures or one
single, epic saga: the saga of the Ruins of the Dragon Lord...<BR><BR><b>
THE DRAGON LORD AWAITS...<BR><BR><BR>CONTENTS<BR>One 64-page and two
128-page rulebooks, containing details for a complete campaign, taking
