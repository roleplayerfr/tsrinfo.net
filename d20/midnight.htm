<b>A hundred years have passed since the shadow fell.</b><BR><BR>As the Third
Age came to an end, the fallen god Izrador triumphed over the free nations of
Aryth. The corrupt lieutenants of the Shadow in the North, the Night Kings,
rule with an iron fist over ruined cities and broken kingdoms. Twisted,
incorporeal spirits hunt down the last true masters of magic, and the fallen
god's dark and secretive priesthood, the legates of the Order of Shadow, seek
out elven spies, dwarven insurgents, and the few brave heroes who stand
defiant against the night.<BR><BR>MIDNIGHT is an exciting new campaign setting
designed for the d20 System. Enter a world where evil rules and darkness has
fallen against the land. Fight for hope and justice in a realm where
desperation and despair hang like a death shroud over shattered empires.
Explore an ancient world where the gods are silent and magic ebbs like the
tide retreating from a dark shore. Embark on an epic journey in a land where
heroes are comdemned and the elder races are hunted to the brink of extinction.
Welcome to MIDNIGHT.
