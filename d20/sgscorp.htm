<center><b>Savage Desert Raiders</b><BR><BR>What are scorpionfolk and
where do they come from? This is a question that many have asked; what is
known is that they are brutal and destructive. But who are they really,
and how can they be so savage and yet still exist? Surely they would all
have killed one another in an orgy of violence; so there must be more to
the scorpionfolk than meets the eye. The Slayer's Guide to Scorpionfolk
will lift the veil that obscures these fascinating and dangerous creatures
from mortal ken.<BR><BR>The first travellers realise they are the targets
of a scorpionfolk raid is when they are faced with the awesome vision of
these huge creature charging them. Somewhat akin to centaurs, these
creatures appear to be the blending of two forms, that of a monstrous
scorpion some 10 feet in length with a human upper torso. Bearing down on
their prey with lance, claws and stinger twitching, the folk make short
work of their targets taking what they will; food valuables and other
treasure. Most caravan routes through the hot barren lands avoid known
hot spots of scorpionfolk activity, but it is not always possible to
gauge where they will hit. It is much safer to find routes around than to
venture into the known haunts of the folk, they acknowledge no authority
or boundaries other than their own. Only the most powerful and well-armed
expeditions venture into the stomping grounds of the folk, and then only
at great need.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</b><BR><BR><table cellpadding="5">
