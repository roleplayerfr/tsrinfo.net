<center>To some, the hedge wizard might seem to be a poor substitue for the
wizard or sorcerer. Not as flashy as the latter, nor as recognised as the
former. This is, however, a dangerous misconception. The hedge wizard is a
rural, backwoods magician who relies as much on the superstition of his
neighbours as on actual magic to make a living. He specialises in the use of
cantrips, the minor incantations and simple spells that are largely ignored by
most wizards and sorcerers.<BR><BR>
This is the 7<sup><font size="-1">th</font></sup> book of the <i>Power Classes</i>
series from Mongoose publishing. Designed to be seamlessly slotted into any fantasy-based d20
system game, each of these mini-supplements introduce an entirely new core
character class, adding a whole new dimension to campaigns. Players will find
full details on how to use the new character class, greatly increasing the
wealth of options they are presented with by the core rulebooks while Games
Masters may revel in the wide variety of new classes they have at their
disposal for non-player characters in their campaigns. Each Power Class
booklet can provide hours of gaming enjoyment at an all new low cost.<BR><BR><b>
