<i>A temple in disrepair looms out of the mist. As you approach, you
notice that the debris results not so much from ruin as disinterest.
It appears that grandiose plans have disolved due to insufficient
money, time or will. It seems a shame; the structure could have been
so beautiful.<BR><BR>A nagging thought crosses your mind. Could this
be the work of Akrasia, the Goddess of Distraction? Many do not see
her as a threat. Still, her agents have brought down empires, and her
influence saps the life from communities until they fall, rotten
within, to the slightest threat.<BR><BR>Ah, but who cares? There is
no doubt little of value or threat within. Might as well find a
comfortable spot and turn in early tonight. There's always tomorrow
for great deeds...</i><BR><BR>Akrasia, Thief of Time, is a vignette
