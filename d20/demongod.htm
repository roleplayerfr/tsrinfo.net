<b>THE DEMON GOD...</b></center><BR><i>A name so old and obscure, most
people no longer remember the terror it conceals. Now, something evil
has slithered its way into the village of Golden Lake, and into the minds
and souls of the villagers. Has the old temple to the demon prince
Ochremeshk become a threat again after so many centuries? And how can
it be stopped when its location remains lost in plain sight?</i><BR><BR>
The cultists of the demon god are out to get you. Track them down and
wipe them out in their own lair in this challenging d20 adventure for
14th- and 15th-level characters. <i>Demon God's Fane</i> serves as a
companion to the popular <a href="eldritch.htm"><i>The
Book of Eldritch Might</i></a>, featuring many of that sourcebook's
high magic prestige classes, feats, spells, magic items, and more.<BR><BR>
Monte Cook, known for his previous adventures like <a href="../dd1/lom.htm">
<i>Labyrinth of Madness</i></a>, <a href="../dd1/pih.htm"><i>A
