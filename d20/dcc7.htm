Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
In this adventure, the coastal village of Fair Haven needs the characters'
help. For decades, Fair Haven has relied upon its lighthouse to guide
merchant vessels into port. But on a recent stormy night, the lighthouse
suddenly failed. The trading ship Nymph's Kiss was dashed on the rocks,
and smugglers have already raided the wreck. Somebody has to restore
the lighthouse, but the locals are afraid to go near because it shows all
the signs of being haunted. Yet there might be more to the story, since
there's something living in the sea caves below...<BR><BR>
If you enjoy this adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl Classics
series!
