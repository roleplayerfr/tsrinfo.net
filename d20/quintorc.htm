<center>Children of violence, half-orcs seem condemned to lead a life of
violence from the moment they leave their mothers' womb. Few half-breeds
are as commonly scorned and looked upon with so much prejudice as the
half-orc, born from an union not as foul as to be unholy but still not
'clean' or eagerly expected in the least. Whether they grow up amidst
humans or raised by orcs, a half-orc child can look forward to a life
filled with abuse and misunderstanding.<BR><BR>At their core, half-orcs
raised by humans are not as different as those taken in by an orcish
tribe even if their outward demeanour is completly different. A runt
raised by orcs learns to endure the physical abuse of other orcs his age,
just like a bastard child must endure the psychological and emotional
torture of growing up in human society. Even those rare half-orcs who
grow up without ties to either society, or as a result of both have the
same core of rage, shame and resentment that makes up most of a
half-orc's mindset. With the help of this sourcebook, however, any
character choosing the half-orc race will find many alternatives of
growth for any class the character follows beyond the stereotypical
barbarian.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</b><BR><table cellpadding="5">
