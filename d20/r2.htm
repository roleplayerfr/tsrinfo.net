more! Do you dare assault the hidden Temple of Orcus? Can you locate the
famed Passage to the Gates of Hell? Will you be able to find the fabled
Mushroom of Youth or the Hall of the Titan Ereg Tal? Or will you fall prey

to descend still further into Rappan Athuk will learn the answer. A pity
you won't live to tell your tale...<BR><BR><center><b>Darkness and Evil</b></center>
