Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
Centuries ago, a seemingly immortal yuan-ti warrior known as the Emerald
Cobra ruled over the vast Eztenqui Jungles with an iron fist. Finally,
a wizard managed to end the evil serpent's reign of terror by trapping its
life essence in a magical staff. The staff became both the figurative
and literal heart of Voltigeur, resting in an enchanted case in the center
of the town as a symbol of victory. But now the magic staff has vanished.
Since the disappearance, merchant caravans traveling to Voltigeur have
been savagely attacked. The few survivors report that their attackers
were serpent-men swearing fealty to the reborn Emerald Cobra! Legends
speak of an old pyramid near Mount Icpitl that was once the Emerald
Cobra's palace. Can the heroes locate this ancient ruin and destroy
the reborn Emerald Cobra?<BR><BR>
If you enjoy this adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl Classics
series!
