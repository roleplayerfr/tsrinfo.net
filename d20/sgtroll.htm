<center><b>A Horrid Enemy</b><BR><BR>The Slayer's Guide to Trolls provides
detailed information on trollish physiology, habitat, and society,
giving you a fundmental level of understanding on how this race exists
and interacts with the rest of the world. Players can learn the types
of combat tactics trolls are likely to employ against their characters
and Games Masters are given guidelines on how to introduce trolls into
their existing campaigns, and will also benefit from material
demonstrating how to portray these creatures to the players. A few
troll subspecies can change the expectations of any encounter, as do
the new trollish feats that alter the standard troll into something
even more horrific. Finally, a complete troll lair is featured to be
used as either an extended encounter, the basis for a complete set of
scenarios, or even just as an example of how such troll lairs are
generally laid out. There are more to trolls than first meets the eye.
After reading the Slayer's Guide to Trolls, you may never view these
monsters in quite the same way again.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find<BR><BR>
