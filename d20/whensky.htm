very earth trembles - and horrifying new creatures and potent magic arise.<BR><BR>
This event book serves as a guide for DMs and players whose world is struck -
and struck hard - by a meteor. <i>When the Sky Falls</i> offers a variety of
new prestige classes for characters close to the impact, a variant magic
system powered by residual meteor fragments, and many new feats, spells, and
items. The book also describes frightening new monsters: creatures twisted by
their proximity to the Afterfall.<BR><BR>Bruce Cordell is also known for his
