Behold: the ultimate resource for the ultimate monster. With enough
material to sustain a campaign for years, the Complete Guide to Beholders
offers a completely new perspective on this misunderstood monster. Far
more than simply a book of new options, this work is a transformation of
the beholder. It expands their social structure and cultural life in
new ways, forever changing the way you play them. Inside you will find:<BR><BR>
<ul><li>A comprehensive look at the different varieties of beholders,
including the nation-like Dominions by which they seperate themselves, the
different ideologies of each Dominion, and stats for more than a dozen
variants, including the Eyetouched template.</ul><ul><li>A eye-opening
look at beholder cultists and their infiltration of humanoid civilzations,
including everything you need to play a cultist or one of the beholders'
corrupted eyekin servants.</ul><ul><li>A detailed guide to creating
memorable beholder encounters, adventures, and long-term campaigns,
covering tactical advice for combat, maps of common beholder lair designs,
and new classes, feats, equipment, and magic items just for beholders.</ul><ul><li>
New player options for fighting <i>against</i> beholders, including new
classes, spells, and organizations.</ul>And much more, all of it
compatible with the 3.5 revision, with free bonus material available
online.<BR><BR><center><i>Requires the use of the Dungeons & Dragons,
