<b>Not Just the Greens...</b><BR><BR>There's much, much more to the monstrous
races than just hacking and slashing. They're more like you than most are
willing to admit. Now it's your chance to walk a mile in their shoes. We've
given you the rules to do the same thing with the Green Races already...
here's six more monstrous races - the centaur, janni, minotaur, rakshasa,
satyr and troglodyte - each uniquely different from the more common Green
Races. You may think you know these creatures, but do you have the guts
to play for the other team?<BR><BR><b>...More than Just another Wizard
with a Staff.</b><BR><BR>Wizards and sorcerers are the backbone of almost
every adventuring party. They may be physically weak, but their arcane
abilities more than make up for that fact. Yet, even the most powerful
wizard is predictable, and thus is at a disadvantage. That changes now.
Five new core spellcasting classes and twelve prestige classes give you
more variety than you've ever had before, more choices you can make with
your characters to make them as versatile or specialized as you want. No
matter what, you won't have just another wizard anymore!<BR><BR><b>Now
You Can Build the Biggest and Baddest!</b><BR><BR>There's only so much
you can do with the core races and classes. Well, now you've got more
choices than ever before. You don't have to become an undead lord or sell
your soul to become the king of the hill anymore. Whether you're looking
to start out with a new character with more options open to you or whether
you're a GM that wants to build an opponent that will prove a challenge to
a group of know-it-alls, this book has what you need!<BR><BR>Visit
