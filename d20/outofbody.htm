Welcome to the youngest and most turbulent of the realms, a mountainous
expanse known as Tirna'cel. This place was once well known for its
power-mongering warlords, magic-wielding sorcerors, and archfiends from
the deepest pits of the Abyss. But in the last 600 years, this has
changed. Tirna'cel is a peaceful and welcoming land now, due in no
small part to the efforts of the warlord Tirna'gael, a member of the
land's founding nobility.<BR>Tirna'gael turned against the other rulers
without warning, attacking and overwhelming them without remorse. He
is said to have suddenly grown stronger and more powerful. The reasons
for his remarkable gain in power are unknown, though they are routinely
connected to items believed to have been emtombed with him by the
then-newly formed paladin's order of Garadon.<BR>After his death, Tirna'gael's
body was interred in his central citadel, a large stone fortress suspended
over an immense lava pit. There he has rested for nearly 600 years,
protected by the surrounding hostile environment and a small cadre of
supernatural guardians summoned and permanently bound by the Order of
Garadon.<BR>But recently, rumors have reached the corridors of Tirna'cel's
capital city that invaders have struck the fallen hero's burial place,
in search of one or more of his legendary magic items. So far, all
that is known of these foul creatures is that they are native to the
environment, being resistant to the fiery dangers of the area.<BR>Your
party has been summoned by the lord of the realm, who has charged you
with ending the threat to Tirna'gael's tomb and the potential destruction
of the land's long-enduring peace. If the sources of Tirna'gael's
power were to fall into the wrong hands, it could mean the end of the
nation as you know it.
