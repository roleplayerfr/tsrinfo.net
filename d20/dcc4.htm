Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>In this all-new adventure,
the characters acquire a treasure map tatooed on tanned human skin. It
shows the location of famed pirate Blood Jack's last haul, where hundreds
of thousands of gold coins lie waiting to be taken. But exploring his
long-abandoned island hideaway isn't as easy as it first seems. Bloody
Jack didn't leave his treasure unguarded - and the best way to keep the
undead legions well-stocked is to lure treasure-hunters to their death...<BR><BR>
If you enjoy this adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl
Classics series!
