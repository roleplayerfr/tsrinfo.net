<b>A GOD DIES...</b><BR><BR>...and while the faithful mourn, other make their
move.<BR><BR>Malhavoc Press proudly presents the first d20 event book, a "how-to"
guide for players and DMs. <i>Requiem for a God</i> supposes that a major
event has taken place in your campaign: the death of an immortal being.<BR><BR>
This book has all you need to introduce the demise of a divine power into your
game. DM notes cover the death's repercussions on the campaign, and new
prestige classes tap into the departed god's power. Short tie-in adventures
feature power-mad villains seeking to hoard their new might while cosmic
forces move to realign the balance.<BR><BR>Characters can wield artifacts made
of god-relics and spells fueled by lingering divine essence. Meanwhile, dark
creatures born of the god's passing challenge adventurers of all levels.<BR><BR>
Kill a god in your game. Then watch what happens.<BR><BR><center>Monte Cook,
