Remember the good old days, when adventures were underground, NPCs were
there to be killed, and the finale of every dungeon was a dragon on the
20th level? Those days are back. Dungeon Crawl Classics adventures don't
waste your time with long-winded speeches, weird campaign settings, or
NPCs who aren't meant to be killed. Each adventure is 100% good, solid
dungeon crawl, with the monsters you know, the traps you remember, and the
secret doors you know are there somewhere.<BR><BR>
This module is a collection of six related adventures designed to be played
nonconsecutively over the course of a campaign. Each adventure builds on
the one before it, but is complete and stand-alone. This allows the DM to
weave an ongoing plot line into his larger campaign, which gets revealed
bit by bit, one episode at a time. As the heroes progress in level, they
slowly uncover a great plot by an ancient summoner to forge the <i>Oculum
Infernae</i>, a terrifying artifact that will allow him to read the
heavens with perfect clarity. Only by stopping his efforts can the heroes
ensure that the evil wizard won't summon an army of unspeakable terror!
If you enjoy this adventure, look for the rest of the Dungeon Crawl Classics
series!
