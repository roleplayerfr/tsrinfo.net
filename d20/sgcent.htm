<center><b>Enigmatic Friend and Foe</b><BR><BR>Centaurs are a highly
secretive race and there are few who have had prolonged contact with
them. The Slayer's Guide to Centaurs is the most detailed resource any
adventurer may find for these mysterious and shy creatures.<BR><BR>
Within these pages, you will discover how to approach and gain the
friendship of a Centaur village, as well as how to defend yourself when
peaceful negotiations break down. You will encounter the sheer
terrifying power of the Centaur Charge and the awesome might of that
backbone of Centaur culture, the druids. The Slayer's Guide to
Centaurs is the essential read for any adventurer planning to venture
into the great forests.<BR><BR>
