Nearly all monsters are shrouded in some mystery. Even the so-called 'common'
beasts that plague the intelligent races are in some ways unknown despite efforts
to probe their secrets. Many become increasingly familiar to us as we
constantly ask of our friends and allies, and from this information we piece
together what we can. However, there are some creatures that will forever
resist our attempts. Those that live beyond the material world are, by
definition, inexplicable: anything we can learn is so otherworldly as to defy
interpretation. However, even here on this plane there are creatures that we
cannot hope to gather much information on. Of these creatures, the kraken
stands in the forefront as the most mysterious. The Slayers Guide to Kraken
offers an enormous amount of detail on these creatures, from their society
through to kraken-worshipping prestige classes. A fully detailed example lair
is also presented, to get your players right into the thick of things!
