<center>In the minds of all sentient creatures lies the potential to change
the world. Every thought, every action resonates throughout reality.
Actions and thoughts intersect, collide, contradict, and merge together to
form the fabric of cause and effect that make up 'reality' as people
understand it.<BR><BR>Most people express their power to change the world
through their bodies. They take up swords or tools, craft words or art.
A handful find they wield incredible arcane or divine powers, changing all
of creation by moving forces they barely understand.<BR><BR>A rare cursed
few do not suffer the limits that constrain mortal men. They alter the
shape of the universe by will alone. They move mountains, light forest
fires, transport themselves though time and space without drawing on
anything but themselves. They have what many would consider the ultimate
gift; to transform thought into definite action unbound by the constraints
of the physical world. This ultimate gift brings with it a terrible curse.
Each world shaper must maintain constant focus, constant control over the
power within. A stray thought could become a bird. A flare of anger may
ignite an inferno that destroys a town. Unbridled by the buffer of
physical action these gifted individuals must struggle constantly to
establish boundaries on their own desires. Even a moment's failure can
bring ruin to everything they hold dear.<BR><BR>They are the world shapers,
world breakers, dreamers and destroyers. Where they walk, reality itself
bows down.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</b><BR><BR><table cellpadding="5">
