<center><b>The Mighty Fleet</b><BR><BR>War is a great beast that bears
no respect for anything or anyone. Whenever there is ambition or a
desire for power, there will be war. The sea is not an exception; ever
since the first sentient race used anything that floated to bring harm
to enemies, the ocean became one of many battlefields, and its watery
depths are the final resting place for those who fell in battle, sunken
ships as their only grave and monument. Warships are as common a sight
as merchants and explorers, and captains of any type of vessel must
learn to recognise the outline of a ship, for telling friend from foe
is a skill that can save many lives on the open seas.<BR><BR><b>Inside
You Will Find:<BR><BR>War at Sea:</b> A detailed look at just how the
different races fight at sea and what influences their crews and
warships.<BR><BR><b>Crews:</b> Hire greatly specialised crews and
captains, all designed to get the very best out of the largest vessels
to ever set sail on the high seas.<BR><BR><b>Weaponry:</b> New
shipboard weapons employed by many races, from the innocuous Snaring
Anchor to the devastating beam of the Sun Mirror.<BR><BR><b>Ships of
War:</b> A multitude of new ships, covering a huge range of warships and
complete with detailed deckplans. Confound an enemy with the <i>Fireship</i>,
search the depths of the ocean with the gigantic <i>Razorback</i>
submersible, or fight an entire war from the deck of the mighty ironclad
<i>Thunderchild</i> dreadnought, the greatest ship ever to have set
sail.<BR><BR>FOR PLAYERS AND GAMES MASTERS ALIKE<BR>Requires the use of
