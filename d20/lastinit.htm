<b>A Lost Plea</b><BR><BR>The skeletal body you found in the wilds carried a
plea for help - a plea that was never delivered. Whoever he was, his failure
left his entire brotherhood under siege by a barbarous army of Orcs. Did the
priests and their followers survive the attack, to still live hidden somewhere
in the wilderness? While the dead man you found doesn't talk, his weathered
note bares a map to the secret temple's location.<BR><BR>But the note also
speaks of treasures; Wonders he calls them, that must be saved at all cost.
Perhaps a trip to this temple might be in order. After all, the clerics may
still need some help. Or, more likely, there could be treasures left for
the taking. And with no civilization nearby, the fortification of the temple
is just what you need. Because those very same Orc hordes are now hunting
you.<BR><BR>Tired and cold, you may make it to a temple hidden for years
from prying eyes. It must surely offer some protection, since its defenses
held off invaders long ago. But the temple seems almost alive, and intent
on keeping its secrets from all foreigners.<BR><BR>And perhaps, it might
not be as empty as you think....
