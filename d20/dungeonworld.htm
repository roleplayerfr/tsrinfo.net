darkness!</center><BR><b>Escape the underground realms
that stole your existence!</b><BR><ul><li>An unknown
force has given you fallen character's spirit a reprieve
from death and placed it in a new body on a slab of
cold stone. It is up to you to discover your purpose in
this new underground world where everyone's hand is
turned against you.</ul><ul><li>The gods have abandoned
you. Cut off from ethereal guidance you must make your
own way through deadly caverns with only your wits and
the things you can capture to help you along the way.</ul><ul><li>
Back where you died, your allies know that your spirit
has been stolen and their research tells them that your
brave soul is battling alone on another plane of
existence. Are they brave enough to adventure to where
that soul has been trapped, possibly being trapped
there forever themselves?</ul><ul><li>In this
never-before-seen campaign world, there is no night sky;
there is no sky. As characters struggle from level to
level they meet powerful forces for good or ill all
trying to exist in a damp, dark world not of their
making. A character's death is just the beginning in
the crypts of Dungeon World.</ul><ul><li>World an

presents Nex, the first Dungeon World setting, a
25-level dungeon populate by creatures from throughout
the planes, including 10 new monsters, among them the
nefarious Caretaker's Children.</ul>Visit <a href="http://www.fastforwardgames.com/">

campaign setting presenting a whole new aspect of
fantasy role-playing. Within these pages is a purgatory
of endless tunnels and warrens, a place of the dead or
perhaps not quite dead. When an adventuring character takes
his last breath only to awaken on a cold, stone slab in
utter darkness, his time in Dungeon World has begun!</i><BR><BR>
