<center><b>WHAT'CHA GONNA DO WHEN THEY COME FOR YOU?</b></center><BR>A legal
system is one fo the defining elements of civilization. But it's too often
overlooked in fantasy settings. In a world where high-level characters
can single-handedly defeat armies, how can any powerful individual be
captured or imprisoned?<BR><BR>Just as <a href="dynasties.htm">
<i>Dynasties and Demagogues</i></a> deals with political intrigue, <i>
Crime and Punishment</i> takes an in-depth look at campaigns that focus
on the forces of the law. Players can take the roles of bounty hunters
tracking down mystical renegades, justicars seeking to restore order in a
cesspool of corruption and crime, mage hunter, itinerant justices, the
local sheriff's men, or even spies for the crown.<BR><BR>And consider that
even an innocent adventurer may find himself hunted by the authorities if
he doesn't know what to watch out for. If the characters are on the
wrong side of the law, this book provides information on what they may be
up against, including new magical methods of law enforcement and
imprisonment.<BR><BR><i>Crime and Punishment</i> includes:<BR><BR><ul><li>
Extensive rules on conducting investigations, including new uses for old
skills, new forensic spells, and specialized equipment. Plus new classes
for agents of the law and those who work against them.</ul><ul><li>A
detailed look at different systems of justice, from common law to divine
law, with an emphasis on how such systems can provide opportunities and
challenges for adventurers.</ul><ul><li>Information on running campaigns
based on the law, showing GMs how to bring together a party of bounty
hunters, a royal justice and his entourage, or a group of investigators
solving crimes in a gritty metropolis.</ul><ul><li>Descriptions of a
variety of prisons, ranging from an extraplanar cell, to a stone garden
filled with petrified prisoners, to a full-fledged mystical fortress.</ul>
