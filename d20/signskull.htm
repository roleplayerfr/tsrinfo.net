Lord Thomist frowns through his beard at your questions.<BR><BR>"The
villages in the area are independent at the moment, but I have initiated
discussions with them about swearing fealty to my banner. That is why
it is crucial that this threat - whatever it is - be eliminated
immediately. I can't afford to send troops away from my sworn lands,
so I want you to go out under my banner as a visible symbol of my
protection.<BR><BR>"All we know is what has been reported by travelers
and verified by my men: Two villages have been attacked and everyone in
them - men, women, children, and even livestock - have been killed. To
the youngest child, they were decapitated, their heads flayed of all
flesh and their skulls staked around the town.<BR><BR>"There are no
surviving witnesses, but whatever killed them must have given very
little warning. The bodies were found mostly in their beds. There
seems to have been no sign of resistance or flight.<BR><BR>"If this is
a mundane assault you have my command to slay all offenders. If it is
some kind of vile sorcery you must root out the source and come to me
for help if you cannot handle it yourselves."<BR><BR>Thomist sighs
suddenly and his shoulders slouch forward. "We have no true leads to
aid you. We have no idea what could do this, or where it will strike
next. But it is evil and it must be stopped."
