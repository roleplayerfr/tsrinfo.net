AS THE DAY WOULD QUAKE TO LOOK UPON."<BR>-<i>HAMLET</i></center><BR>
Deeptown lies in the shadows of mountains, a town where anything is for
sale if you can only meet the price. But in the wild surrounding
valleys of the Deep, it's the bandits who make the darkest deals - and
their ambition comes at a cost far greater than the contents of any
wayward caravan.<BR><BR>You and your team have just been handed a new
job: disrupt a meeting between a bandit lord and his mysterious new
allies. At a remote mountain villa, you will strike hard and fast and
leave terror in your wake. They give you the tools. You provide the
talent. Survive, and you'll be well rewarded. Fail, and <i>you'll</i>
pay the price.<BR><BR><center>YOU'VE GOT THREE DAYS TO RAISE SOME HELL.</center>
