<center><b>Hate and Spite</b><BR><BR>Kobolds are a common sight in many campaign
worlds; deemed by most adventurers to be a minor nuisance at best. Certainly,
most experienced adventurers would question the need to study kobolds in any
great depth, but then, few have faced the full might of a kobold clan and lived
long enough to warn others of the peril they offer. <i>The Slayer's Guide to
Kobolds</i> offers insight to all adventurers in the culture and society of
this vicious race, enabling them to track down, engage and wipe out dozens of
these murderous beasts. It can only be hoped that such efforts will be enough
to stall and drive back a race that is, almost literally, numberless.<BR><BR>
No race in any campaign world, however, exists solely to provide cannon fodder
for allegedly heroic aventurers. <i>The Slayer's Guide to Kobolds</i> redresses
this imbalance by giving Games Masters the information they need to make
kobolds a solid and coherent part of their campaign. No longer will players
merely scoff and draw their swords when they meet a group of kobolds within
some ancient ruin. Finally, kobolds will have the respect they have always
deserved.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</b><BR><BR><table cellspacing=10><tr><td>
