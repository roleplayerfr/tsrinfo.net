<center>The fourth in the 'Classic Play' series from Mongoose Publishing,
<i>The Book of Adventuring</i> covers a topic of focal importance to any d20
game in unprecedented depth and detail. This series forms a collection of
definitive works on subjects relevant to any gaming group.<BR><BR>Your
party is strung along a crumbling ledge, fifty feet above a roaring
torrent of water, out of spells and badly wounded, while a ravenous
hippogriff circles ominously above. What do you do?<BR><BR><i>The Book of
Adventuring</i> reveals the answers.<BR><BR>Designed for use by those
role-players who are new to the hobby or those modest enough to admit
they do not already know it all, <i>The Book of Adventuring</i> leads you
on the road to becoming a better adventurer.<BR><BR>Learn the importance
of even the most insignificant pieces of equipment and exactly what they
can do for you. Discover the tactics required to survive once the going
gets tough and what role your character brings to the party as a whole.<BR><BR>
This is only the tip of the iceberg, every element of the adventurer's
craft is detailed in its own chapter, from surviving the dangers of the
wilderness to the perils of extraplanar travel; from feeding yourself in
the gloomy depths of a drow cavern to overcoming dangers of a very
different kind as you make your way through the streets and alleys of a
bustling city. Disparate environments they may be, but equally perilous.<BR><BR>
This valuable tome is the essential guide to all things adventuring.<BR><BR>
RECOMMENDED FOR PLAYERS & GAMES MASTERS ALIKE</center>
