<center>I am old now and I fear I have little time left to chronicle
all that I have learned in my travels.<BR>My life has been both blessed
and cursed. I am a Child of the Waking Dream, touched by fate and
bound to a being in another far off world.<BR>The common folk would
call me a hero, the great Pantheon, a threat.<BR>I walk a fine line
between the light and the shadows.<BR>Stalking the nightmares sent from
a mystical realm I can neither see nor visit.<BR><BR>There are others
like me and it is for them that I try in these late years to chronicle
what I know.<BR>I have been on "The Hunt" for more than three decades
and I have seen most of what there is to see of this world.<BR>In this
tome I will introduce you as best I can to all the world, its kingdoms,
its people and its ways.<BR><BR>Take heed, the hunt never ends for the
Children of the Waking Dream until we are cold in our graves.<BR>That
time may be short of long, glorious of tragic, and what you learn here
may make the difference.<BR><BR>Dimitri Amadon<BR>An excerpt from
