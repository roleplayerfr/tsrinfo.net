<center>The bard does a little bit of everything: cast spells, heal, fight with a
sword. He also brings a unique skills set and two special abilities to the
table. He has all of the skills of a rogue and a wizard, with a broad range of
knowledge. He also has a chance to know anything (represented by his bardic
knowledge ability). Finally he can create some enchantment like effects using
the power of his own performance.<BR><BR>Here you will find a plethora of options
for giving your bard that little bit of extra focus. From combat worthy bards
to bards that are rogues to scholars with a creative flair you can make them
all here.<BR><BR>The Quintessential Bard offers players a comprehensive guide
to playing characters of this class that will prove to be invaluable for
