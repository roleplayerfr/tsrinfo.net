The Underdark Adventure Guide is a world-neutral, standalone guide to
adventuring in the strange, alien world of the underdark. The underdark is
far more than just dungeons and caves. It is a verifiable underground
continent, populated by advanced civilizations, ancient ruins, sunless
seas, alien magic, bizarre creatures, and the horrid denizens of the
gloom. The standards of the surface world hold no sway in the underdark,
and its mysteries, ferocity, and danger will challenge even the hardiest
of adventurers.<BR><BR>Underdark adventures are easy to integrate with an
exisiting campaign, as the very nature of the underdark leads itself to
layering - simply arrange for the discovery of a subterranean portal, and
the land beneath your existing campaign has a new life. The Underdark
Adventure Guide includes everything you need to create a compelling
underdark campaign.<BR><BR><ul><li>New character options for underdark
explorers, ranging from new feats and adventuring gear to prestige
classes specially tailored to the underdark races: drow, derro, duergar,
svirfneblin, and troglodytes.<li>More than a dozen new monsters native
to the underdark, plus a variety of specialized plants and bizarre
funguses.<li>Extensive guidelines and world-building advice for constructing
your own underdark region.<li>A dozen fully developed points of interest.
You can use these piecemeal as drop-in locations in your existing
campaign, or use them together as a fully-developed, integrated underdark
region.</ul>The Underdark Adventure Guide is completely world-neutral and
standalone.
