<center>The crumbling walls of Bergholt sit astride a transhipment point between
the far-flung realms to the east and west. The citizens of this backwash consider
themselves free of the chaos of the world. This myth rests well with those
weary travelers seeking respite from the horrors of the trail and the vile
intrigues of the lands. But villainous deeds are afoot beneath the veil, luring
adventurers to journey Bergholt's dark streets in pursuit of answers and a
common thief.<BR><BR>This d20 System Companion Book begins the "Dens of
Iniquity" campaign backdrop. Set in the World of Inzae, it continues the
story of the "Death on the Treklant" trilogy, or stands alone as the first
part of an intriguing city adventure. With over 46 encounter areas, cultural
and historical background information, new weapons, and new skill interpretations,
this sourcebook is perfect for DMs and players seeking the thrills of gritty
urban adventure.</center>
