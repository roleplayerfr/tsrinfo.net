Returning home from your most recent adventure, you find yourselves in
the alpine hamlet of Feldspar. This small, sleepy village makes its
living from the sale of lumber, animal skins, and most importantly, its
small silver mine.<BR><BR>Feldspar is not unlike a dozen or more other
hamlets you've traveled through in the course of your adventures. The
only thing it really has going for it is its inn, the Mountain Pine.
Haddy Lowbon, the Mountain Pine's proprietor, is notorious for his
strong ale and hot meals. The inn's rooms are also well regarded by
travelers, with comfortable beds stuffed with fresh straw and thick
quilts to ward off the mountain chill.<BR><BR>As you trudge into town
after another long journey, you welcome the prospect of at least one
night of warmth and comfort in the welcoming inn.
