<center>Elementals are among the most primal forces in the mythology of
many cultures, raw elements given life. This in turn has gifted them a firm
place in many a campaign world. Some authorities believe all matter to be
made from the four elements, with even humans and other sentient creatures
being possessed of an elemental nature.<BR><BR>Fighting an elemental is
like fighting a whirlwind, a raging inferno, a mountain or the sea itself.
You can try and, if you are powerful enough, possibly even succeed, but
there is a certain implacable quality to the elements. All can seem
unstoppable forces and the earth elemental might also be regarded as an
immovable object. Anyone who battles with such powers must fear being
overcome, unless they can employ similarly strong forces themselves.<BR><BR>
<i>The Slayer's Guide to Elementals</i> compiles knowledge drawn from
scholarly works alongside tactics and survival tips offered by adventurers
who have fought with elementals and lived to tell the tale. Games Masters
will learn many intricate details about elemental life and culture,
enabling them to make truly memorable encounters with these creatures for
their players, while players themselves may learn a thing or two that
might just save the lives of their characters.<BR><BR>Continuing this
series of supplements, <i>The Slayer's Guide to Elementals</i> is designed
for use in all fantasy-based d20 game and takes an exhaustive look at
these fascinating creatures, thoroughly detailing their beliefs, society
and methods of warfare.<BR><BR>FOR GAMES MASTERS AND PLAYERS ALIKE</center>
