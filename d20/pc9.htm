<center>From a roleplaying standpoint, pirates are a wonderful addition to our
games. They are fierce, self-reliant characters with a crew of men willing to do
their bidding, a ship to call their home that grants them the ultimate mobility
to travel as they wish and a license to do as they please lest someone do it to
them first. With pirates come the brotherhood and code of the sea, a form of
unwritten law that creates a grand backdrop for adventures of buccaneering and
bounty-chasing. Hoist the main sails and batten down the hatches; there's
glory to be had, me mates!<BR><BR>
This is the ninth book of the Power Classes
series from Mongoose publishing. Designed to be seamlessly slotted into any fantasy-based d20
system game, each of these mini-supplements introduces an entirely new core
character class, adding a whole new dimension to campaigns. Players will find
full details on how to use the new character class, greatly increasing the
wealth of options they are presented with by the core rulebooks while Games
Masters may revel in the wide variety of new classes they have at their
disposal for non-player characters in their campaigns. Each Power Class
booklet can provide hours of gaming enjoyment at an all-new low cost.<BR><BR><b>
