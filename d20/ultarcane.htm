<center>From the bard who travels far and wide across the land, bringing wisdom
and tales to the common folk, to the powerful wizard who hold sway over vast
tracks of land by sole virtue of his arcane might. Magic is an integral part of
many a fantasy campaign, be it limited or limitless. Those who wield it are
met throughout the lands they travel with awe, suspicion and occasionally
fear. Tales of evil sorcerers abound and legends are beset with reference to
mighty warrior mages. Despite this, however, one thing is certain; it is not
magic that is powerful, in and of itself, it is more accurately, how it is
used. Even the most powerful of mages can be toppled by an inventive spellcaster,
no matter their power. Knowledge is power, nothing more so than magic bears
testament to the truth of that statement.<BR><BR>The <i>Ultimate Arcane Spellbook</i>
has been developed to aid both players and Games Masters alike as they venture
into a wider and more magical world. Presented herein are a wealth of spells
and information designed specifically for spellcasters, be they heroes or
villains.<BR><BR>Presented alphabetically for speed and ease of reference and
fully compatible with the latest revision of the d20 system, the <i>Ultimate
Arcane Spellbook</i> is a tome of knowledge no gaming table should be without.</center>
