<i><b>The Wizard’s Amulet</b> is a short, introductory adventure for
six newly created good-aligned 1st-level characters. The adventure
revolves around Corian, a fledgling Sorcerer. While an apprentice,
Corian discovered a letter written by a wizard named Eralion, who it
is said some years ago attempted to become a lich - and failed.
Accompanying the letter was a mysterious amulet with strange markings.
Joined by newfound companions, Corian set off in search of Eralion’s
keep and his supposedly unguarded treasure. But Corian is not alone
in desiring to unlock the mystery of Eralion’s fate. Darker, more evil
forces have designs on the secrets reputedly hidden with Eralion -
forces willing to stop at nothing to obtain...<b>The Wizard's Amulet.</b><BR><BR><center>
