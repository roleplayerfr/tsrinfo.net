They lurk in every shadow, hide in the darkest lairs, and sneak through the
undergrowth almost undetected. They are as present as sun, moon and stars,
but they are ultimately reviled. The denizens of fantasy worlds everywhere,
with their sharp claws and horrid biting teeth made famous by epic tales of
heroism where they are slaughtered in their thousands - but what is a Goblin
really like, what drives these creatures, are they all evil or are they
merely misunderstood?<BR><BR>Within the pages of this tome you will find a
new look at Goblins, their personality and various types, what they do
in their spare time and their weapons and armor. How they use poisons and
how they create and defend their lairs. What they prefer to eat, what
they do not like to eat. The Goblin's creation myth, suitable for any
world or setting; and most importantly, 'everything you ever wanted to
know about Goblins' but were too terrified or amused to ask.<BR><BR><i>
Goblins</i> is a tome rich in information and produced to Dark Quest's
standards for humor, detail, providing an askew look at these nighmarish
little monsters. One lone Goblin may not provide much of a threat, but
when applied in great numbers they can often turn even the most seasoned
adventurer into a gibbering wreck. Learn how to get the best out of
these insidious little creatures and play them to the hilt.<BR><BR>The
book also includes a number of Goblin NPCs complete with statistics,
personalities and backgrounds ready to throw into the mix.
