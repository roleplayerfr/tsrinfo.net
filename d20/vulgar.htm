Thieves' World</i>. The grittiest city in fantasy is now yours to explore. For
as long as the city has stood, it has weathered divine wars, plague, famine,
fires, an invasion, cults, and worse - but are there heroes left to fight against
the newest plot to destroy this infamous city?<BR><BR>A sudden and seemingly
random murder in the Vulgar Unicorn puts the heroes' freedom in jeopardy. To
clear their names, they have to get to the bottom of a terrifying plot to infect
the city with a vicious plague. From the outset, the action keeps coming, taking
the heroes from the Maze to the Swamp of Night's Secrets, and embroiling them
in a vicious plot involving Dyareelan cultists, diseased swine, assassins, and
more!<BR><BR><i>Murder at the Vulgar Unicorn</i> includes:<BR><BR><ul><li>A
complex mystery chock full of action and adventure.</ul><ul><li>New monsters
including the Bengil Crab and the Fenniath.</ul><ul><li>Six player handouts.</ul><ul><li>
Five pre-generated characters so you can get started right away!</ul><ul><li>
Stats for typically encountered NPCs like Beggars, Guards, Merchants and more.</ul><ul><li>
13 side adventures and encounters to enchance play</ul><ul><li>A detailed map
and room description of the Vulgar Unicorn: fantasy's seediest tavern!</ul>Set
in the Irrune Era, this adventure provides suggestions for adapting it to the
Sanctuary of the classic series. <i>Murder at the Vulgar Unicorn</i>
accomodates parties of four to six characters, and while suggested for 1st-level
heroes, it can be used with modification for parties of any level. Useable as
the start of a new campaign or as a stand-alone adventure, this adventure sets
the tone for the <i>Thieves' World</i> campaign setting.<BR><BR>Though not
requires, a copy of Green Ronin's <a href="twpm.htm"></a><i>Thieves'
World Player's Manual</i> allows you to make the most use of this exciting
adventure.<BR><BR><center><b>THE WORLD OF SANCTUARY AWAITS YOU!</b></center>
