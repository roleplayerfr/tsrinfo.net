<center><b>Six Degrees of Prestidigitation!</b></center><BR>Sorcerers and
wizards are not the only practioners of the magical arts. Esoteric orders
of arcane initiates push the boundaries of magic beyond the limits of
tomes and blood. <b><i>Aracana: Societies of Magic</i></b> details six
different organizations that employ unique styles of magic to achieve
their ends.<BR><BR><b>Abbey of Green Steel:</b> Some say that the
self-discipline needed to master the arts of the monk is incompatible
with the pursuit of magic. The Abbey of Green Steel begs to differ.<BR><BR>
<b>The Dragon Gang:</b> Many sorcerers claim the blood of dragons flows
through their veins. The criminals of the Dragon Gang could teach them
a thing or two...<BR><BR><b>The School Beyond the Veil:</b> This martial
school has woven divination and prophecy into a unique fighting style
that creates the deadliest warriors in the world - because they know
what their opponents will do next. But knowledge, as they say, is a
double-edged sword...<BR><BR><b>Servants of Decay:</b> Cities are the
highest achievement of any civilized culture and the fount of their
power. Yet, not everyone views cities with pleasure; many see them as
cancers upon the face of Mother Earth. Such are the Servants of Decay.<BR><BR>
<b>Tribunal of Arcane Law:</b> PCs may laugh at the feeble efforts of
the local watch, but their laughter will turn to tears when they are
charged with Crims Against Wizardry.<BR><BR><b>Temple of the Living
God:</b> Even gods can die, though they strive mightily to avoid
oblivion. This temple is one god's last chance to win back a place in
the heavens.<BR><BR>Each chapter of <b>Arcana: Societies of Magic</b>
includes information on its group's history, goals, and hierarchy, as
well as full <b>d20 System</b> stats for its important personalities.
New skills, feats, spells, templates and prestige classes make it a
complete package. Like Green Ronin's award-winning <b>Freeport</b>
series, <b><i>Arcana: Societies of Magic</i></b> can be used in any
fantasy campaign.<BR><BR><center><i>Arcana: Societies of Magic</i>
