<center>The artificier is a rare individual, able to blend science and magic,
two disciplines often considered to be mutually exclusive, to create potent
items of aid to scholar and warrior alike. With a mind capable of understanding
the intricacies of arcane formulae and the reactions between various alchemical
reagants, he makes a welcome addition to many adventuring parties, albeit one
accompanied by the smell of oil and the whirring sound of gears.<BR><BR>
This is the 6<sup><font size="-1">th</font></sup> book of the <i>Power Classes</i>
series from Mongoose publishing. Designed to be seamlessly slotted into any fantasy-based d20
system game, each of these mini-supplements introduce an entirely new core
character class, adding a whole new dimension to campaigns. Players will find
full details on how to use the new character class, greatly increasing the
wealth of options they are presented with by the core rulebooks while Games
Masters may revel in the wide variety of new classes they have at their
disposal for non-player characters in their campaigns. Each Power Class
booklet can provide hours of gaming enjoyment at an all new low cost.<BR><BR><b>
