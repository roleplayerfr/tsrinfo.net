<center><b>A Crawling Madness!</b><BR>For nearly a millennia, the half ruined
hilltop Keep known as the Temple of Kubla Khan has loomed over the surrounding.
Built by the Dwarven prophet, St. Canor, the ancient temple served to bind a
horrid beast of chaos and evil in eternal imprisonment. For deep beneath the
hallowed temple walls lie the chambers of the Crawling Queen, a creature of
nightmare and dread chaos. St. Canor battled her of old and bound her through
the magic of three Ward Stones. Many years have passed, from that day to this...
and not all the ancient magics binding her are remembered or even working<BR><BR><b>
Plunge into the Depths!</b><BR>In dark, dank hallways and twisted corridors lie
the secrets of the past. Plunge into that black pitch of evil to battle a host
of creatures and strive to keep the binding upon the Crawling Queen. But
strange things lie in the deeps of the world, forgotten magic and unheard of
monsters. It is your time now, to answer the call to the ruins of the ancient
Keep, to defeat a plethora of converging evils and save the world from doom.<BR><BR>
Temple of Kubla Khan is a d20 adventure module designed for 4-6 characters of
levels 6-8.<BR><BR><BR>Originally designed for the 2005 Kubla<BR>Khan Game
Convention in Burlingame, CA<BR><a href="http://www.kublacon.com/">
