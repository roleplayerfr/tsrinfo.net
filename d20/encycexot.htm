<center><b>More Weapons Than You Could Shake A Treant At!</b></center><BR>
The <i>Encyclopedia of Exotic Weapons</i> presents 107 different
weapons, from the Aikuchi to the Blunderbuss to the Zaghnal and
each of which is a real historical weapon. Every entry in this
book (some of which list multiple versions or variants) includes
not only an illustration of the weapon, but also information about
who actually used these weapons - and how they used them - along
with fictional information for use in any campaign.<BR><BR><b>
Accurate Historical Backgrounds</b><BR>Every one of the weapons
featured within the <i>Encyclopedia of Exotic Weapons</i> comes
directly from out own history. Many have their own rich and
storied histories that deserve to be told. Far be it from us
to deprive you of those incredible stories! Every weapon entry
includes an overview of the actual weapon - its design, method
of operation, typical uses, etc. - as well as its Historical
Background - where it came from, who primarily used it and when.
Where else can you find such a compendium of pure knowledge
outside of a library?<BR><BR><b>Magic, Rules, Tables and Feats,
Too!</b><BR>The actual background of these weapons tell the
story of our own history, but that's probably not the primary
reason you're picking this book up. So we've also given you
complete fantasy backgrounds for every weapon featured within
these pages. From the races that use them to the special uses
for and unique abilities of each of these weapons, you'll have
more than enough reasons to bring them into your gaming world.
And we've even added brand-new rules for the use of gunpowder
and siege weapons into the mix, letting you play in almost any
fantasy era. And, of course, all are neatly sorted within
easy-to-read tables. WHo could want anything more?<BR><BR>
