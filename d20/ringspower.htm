<i><b>I must have that precious ring!</b></i><BR><BR>Life is good.
Your character managed to explore all the local ruins, clear out some
monsters, and secure some sizeable treasures. You consider tracking
down some rumors about a powerful fighter's ring, but before you can
follow up on them, the meadows and glens around town begin to mysteriously
transform into swamps and dark forests. Terrible creatures make lairs
around the town and frighten its people. Finally, a worthy quest to
test your mettle! You set out to locate the evil that has caused this
and save the day. But, from the other side of the screen, your
referee thinks to himself, "All he has to do is get by ogre guards,
hill giants, and a covey of green hags, and find a magical ring he
doesn't even know exists. This should prove entertaining."<BR><BR><b><i>
Can one ring change a world?</i></b><BR><BR>This 160-page core rulebook
is filled with the kind of epic magical rings that whole campaigns are
drawn around. Amaze your characters by giving them the <i>Odin Ring
of Riches</i>, but just for 365 days. Give them the challenge of
seeking the <i>Death God's Circlet</i>; all they have to do is give up
their souls for awhile to get to the planet of death. Let your
powerful characters challenge Drawmij himself for his wizard ring.
Will he give it up without a fight? Not bloody likely!<BR><BR><b><i>
Ring of power includes:</i></b><BR><BR>78 enchanted rings, circlets,
and bands, all fully detailed using the d20 System, with brilliant
background information to drop them into any fantasy campaign.<BR><BR>
Each ring is presented in two sections. The first section is an
imaginative story packed with details to give the referee the ring's
turbulent history and present situation. The second section provides
complete d20 System details on the ring and any guardians or wards
protecting its present location.<BR><BR>Precise game information details
how a magical ring is forged, including repair, difficulty, and
elements necessary for creation.<BR><BR>Vist <a href="http://www.fastforwardgames.com/">
