Civilization is still picking up the pieces from an asteroid strike
hundreds of thousand of years ago. The epicenter? Bluffside. Only
200 years after being rediscovered, Bluffside is a boom town boasting
the most precious metal in the known world adamantine. From the ancient
ruins, to the vast Undercity, to the floating port of Sordadon,
Bluffside: City on the Edge is a city that promises to become the home
port for thousands of adventures. The first in our line of truly
modular settings, Bluffside can be easily dropped into any d20 fantasy
campaign world, or in conjunction with out other products.<BR><BR>Bluffside
features the following:<BR><BR><ul><li>New creatures<li>New prestige
classes<LI>New feats<li>Dozens of new magic items, spells, deities, and
much, much more.</ul>Plus, in support of Bluffside, players and GMs alike
will find more on our website:<BR><BR><ul><li>Original fiction based in
Bluffside<li>Free downloadable maps and extras on a password protected
page only available to purchasers of Bluffside: City on the Edge<li>News,
updated regularly, written from within the city walls<li>Working in
conjunction with the FANCC (<a href="http://www.enworld.org/fancc">
http://www.enworld.org/fancc</a>), we offer all GMs and players a place
to freely post their visions of Bluffside. From characters to trade
routes to adventures, we are constructing a complete, approved haven
for all Bluffside enthusiasts to make Bluffside truly their city.
Players and GMs will not only be able to submit their Bluffside work,
they will be able to freely download to work of others using the OGL.
We plan for Bluffside to be the most thoroughly developed city ever.
This netbook will help us immensely in reaching our goal.</ul>
