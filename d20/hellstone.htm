There was a time when darkness reigned. In a was lost to history and myth, the
dread God Chairos engaged on a campaign of destruction and conquest. His goal
was to topple the existing pantheon of Gods, and to establish a dark new order
in which he was supreme... a goal in which he was nearly successful. Only
after a long and vicious campaign between Chairos' diabolic forces and the
celestial armies of good were his evil plans torn asunder, and the God of
Destruction himself forever undone.<BR><BR>But evil never dies. For Chairos'
mightiest weapon in his dark campaign - the Chain of Scars - has been discovered.
Draz Ghulan, a fiendish general with his mind set on revenge, has rekindled
the flames of the ancient conflict with his burning hatred. In his possession
lies the Chthonic Heart, the one item capable of reactivating the awesome
power of the Chain of Scars. Unless Ghulan is stopped, Chairos' lost campaign
of terror and annihilation will begin anew, and the awesome and untold power
of the Chthonic Heart shall be released unto the unsuspecting world.<BR><BR>
To stop him, heroes will have to engage in a deadly race against Ghulan's own
agents of evil, journeying through the stygian depths of the subterranean city
of Il'drazza'kuul and to the horrific demi-plane known as The Sea of Endless
Night. Ultimately, their quest will bring them to Hellstone Deep, an
impenetrable fortress populated with Ghulan's Hellish minions. But within the
Heart lie powers that even Ghulan cannot understand. Powers that, if released,
could spell disaster for all. And darkness shall reign again...<BR><BR><center>
