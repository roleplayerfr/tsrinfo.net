<center><b>Forging Legendary Power</b><BR><BR>Magic items are a staple of
fantasy in any form, evoking images of great deeds done, of dragons, of
heroism and of terrible villainy. The true power of magic items comes
not from their ability to work miracles, but from their ability to evoke
wonder in all of us.<BR><BR>Who does not remember the first time they,
at the successful conclusion of a hard-fought adventure, lifted a new
sword and pulled it, glittering and smoking in the dim light, from its
bejewelled sheath? Who does not recall with fondness the first time
they pointed a staff, uttered a few cryptic phrases and caused the world
to erupt in fire? And who does not feel a sudden thrill each time a
simple <i>detect magic</i> spell wreathes the treasure in cold, blue
possibility?<BR><BR><i>Encyclopaedia Arcane: Magic Item Creation</i> is
dedicated to the expansion and exploration of all the possibilities of
magic items. Within these pages there are new powers, new feats and
even a few new prestige classes, all focused on the use and creation of
magic items. There are new rules for expanding the role of intelligent
magic items and for placing unique qualities and drawbacks in your
magic items. Most importantly, there is a new creation system, the
Mythic System; creating a flaming sword is less a matter of knowing
how to cast <i>burning hands</i> than it is knowing where to go pluck
a tail feather from a phoenix. With the Mythic System, your swordsmen
and rogues will be able to take a more direct hand in constructing
what will be their most prized possessions, giving them a greater
sense of ownership and accomplishment.<BR><BR>No two magic items
will ever be the same again.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</b><BR><BR>
