Cutthroats and cannons!<BR>Many a merchant has made his fortune sailing
the high seas, transporting goods from one port to another, traded
things that are needed for the one thing he needs: gold. One such man
is the powerful sea-trade merchant Baldrick Mornstar, master of a fleet
of cargo-laden ships.<BR>When the shipping lanes Mornstar depends on
become infested with human sharks, the well-heeled merchant casts about
for some brave souls to take care of the problem - permanently. After
numerous attempts by hired scoundrels to deal with the pirates on their
own watery turf fail miserably, Baldrick decides the best way to end
the problem is to catch the blackguards off-guard, hitting them where
they're sure to expect it least: at their land base.<BR>Like the town
crier Mornstar hired shouts, this is a job for stalwart adventurers,
for competent adventurers, but mostly for adventurers who aren't afraid
to use their heads. After all, when you're dealing with scurvy dogs
like these, it's use 'em or lose 'em.
