<center><b>Crude Destroyers</b><BR><BR>In legend, few creatures command
such a powerful, superstitious awe as giants. In fantasy campaigns though,
they are often dismissed by players, seen as a mere step on the way to
higher-level encounters will dragons or demons. A means of garnering
plenty of experience points, but not a serious challenge to a well-equipped
party with a spellcaster or two and the first clue about tactics. Such a
complacent attituse can be very dangerous, particularly if the giants use
their natural advantages to maximum effect.<BR><BR>Giant are often first
encountered singly or in small family groups, either menacing a local
community or preying on travellers through mountainous country. At higher
levels they may be found in larger tribes, often working with lesser
creatures such as ettins, trolls and even lowly orcs, along with the
occasional powerful enemy such as a dragon. With almost as much versatility
as the typical humanoid creature, most giant races are capable of advancing
in character classes, and whether simple barbarians to capitalise on
their obvious strengths or more dangerous classes such as the much-feared
giant sorcerers, adepts, and clerics, these advanced giants can provide a
serious boost to the challenge set by any giant encounter.<BR><BR>This
present volume comprises knowledge drawn from scholarly studies alongside
tactics and survival tips offered by adventurers who have tangled with
giants and lived to tell the tale. Games Masters will learn many intricate
details about giant life and culture, enabling them to make truly memorable
encounters with this race for their players, while the players themselves
may learn a fact or two that might just save the lives of their characters.<BR><BR>
