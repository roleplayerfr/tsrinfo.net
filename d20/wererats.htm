Imagine a race of lycanthropes so devious, so cunning, and so insidious that
they conquer entire kingdoms without ever being seen. These are the wererats.
Their secretive broods infiltrate key posts in the government, military, and
guilds, ensuring political protection from their enemies. When fighting can't
be avoided, the mystic Council of the Flesh unleashes its horrific cross-bred
monsters, which never give a hint as to their wererat origins. When nothing
else works, the hard-hearted Weavers spread filth and disease, eliminating
entire cities with a single contaminated breath. Kingdoms fall, power changes
hands, and the enemies of the wererats are exterminated, without a single
outsider ever knowing how.<BR><BR>The Complete Guide to Wererats is a stand-alone,
world-neutral sourcebook covering everthing you ever wanted to know about
wererats. It includes:<BR><BR><ul><li>Detailed background material on wererat
broods and their insidious plans, including soctial structure, cultural habits,
and combat tactics.<li>Details on the secretive Council of the Flesh and their
lycanthropic madness, including stats for the horrible creatures they have
created.<li>New feats, classes, and skills for wererats and other shapechangers.<li>
Supplemental material online.</ul>The Complete Guide to Wererats is the fifth
volume in the Complete Guide series. Each Complete Guide is exactly what it
sounds like: a complete guide to playing a given kind of monster. As a GM,
you'll learn how to run that monster, both in combat and role-playing situations.
And since every Complete Guide includes guidelines on playing the monster as
a character race, players have new options, too.<BR><BR>The Complete Guide to
Wererats can be inserted easily into any fantasy setting.
