<i>"Now leave this place, for men are coming, men who will blame you
for my death, and see you executed. And remember, the Sarishans conceal
the keys to knowledge within the shadows." The head smiles knowingly
at you, and stops speaking. The spark of life leaves its eyes as blood
oozes from its neck. Suddenly you hear a scream, and look up to see a
woman standing in mute horror on one of the stairways above. She is
looking at the body and the head on the bench, and she starts screaming
loudly, "Murderers! Someone bring the Watch! The Horned King has
been killed!"</i><BR><BR><b>The Queen of Cities</b><BR>Of all the
fabulous empires, kingdoms, nations, city-states, hoary tracts and
territories that sprawl across the face of Onara, the vast expanse of
the lofty Coryani Empire is the greatest. Within this simple tome can
be found the birthplace of greatness and glory, the ancient City of
Coryan.<BR><BR>Surpassed by the newer city of Grand Coryan, Old Coryan
remains as a largely forgotten, neglected relic of the age before the
birth of Empire. Now a den of malcontents, thieves and outcasts, the
ancient metropolis is fertile ground for intrigue and mischief.<BR><BR>
<b>An Emperor's Bloody Oath</b><BR>In the depths of the Shadowed Age,
Yeolin, ancient king of Coryan made a terrible oath sealed in the
blood of the val'Assante line. For millennia the val'Assante have paid
this debt to keep the ancient God of the Hills appeased with rites of
blood and sacrifice by the Horned King. Without this payment, the land
would know blight until the role of Horned King was again filled. The
Horned King now lies dead and only the blood of the first among the
val'Assante can set things aright.<BR><BR><b>Within these pages, one
