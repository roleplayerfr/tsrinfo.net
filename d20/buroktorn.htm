ago, there was peace. The dwarves of Burok Torn and the dark elves of
Dier Drendal fought together against the titanspawn and engaged in
mutually beneficial trade. Yet war and betrayal tore these two races
apart, and today Burok Torn is a place of sorrow, where the sins of the
past trouble the rulers of the present, and the demands of honor drive
elf and dwarf toward tragedy. Forced to fight a desperate war to save
their wounded god, the dark elves assault the dwarves in a seemingly
endless cycle of violence.<BR><i>Burok Torn: City Under Siege</i> details
one of the greatest wonders of the age - the ancient dwarven city of Burok
Torn, where rune magic and faith combine to create an indomitable
realm. This book also provides information on the mysterious city of the
dark elves, Dier Drendal, and the events that have led the dark elves
to make war on their dwarven neighbors. The secrets of the dwarven
rune masters are also revealed, along with rules for playing this and
several other powerful prestige classes. Game masters in any campaign
will find a wealth of information in this book, and players will find
endless challenges in the labyrinthine tunnels of Burok Torn and Dier
Drendal.
