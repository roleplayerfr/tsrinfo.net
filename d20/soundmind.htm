Horror sometimes sneaks up on you in unexpected ways.<BR>In the town of
Bellhold, it's not difficult to realize that something is wrong.
Everyone is irritable and suffering from nightmares, children are
missing, and the local adventuring company has been missing for a week.
Yet the headaches are sure to pass, and the mayor is not especially
worried.<BR>He should be.<BR>Of Sound Mind flings you into a maelstrom
of trouble in which the situation is much, much worse than it first
appears. Before your investigation is over, you will be dangling from
cliffs, descending deep mountain bowels, uncovering lost hoards of
treasure, fleeing from people you thought you knew, and desperately
trying to outwit an enemy that is far more than you could ever imagine.
The fate of thousand hinges on you success or failure.<BR>Think you're
up to it?<BR><BR><center><b>A Psionic Fantasy Adventure Sourcebook.</b></center><BR>
This scenario is designed for four 1st-level characters, but includes
notes on scaling the adventure up to 4th-level.<BR><BR>Featuring a
foreword by Bruce Cordell, this psionic fantasy adventure features the
perfect scenario to launch an ongoing fantasy campaign. Easily adapted
for non-psionic use, this sourcebook includes new monsters, new magic
and psionic items, a new spell, a collection of player handouts, and a
complete set of full-color character and monster counters for tabletop
play.
