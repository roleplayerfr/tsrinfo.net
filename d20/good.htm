<center><b>HEROISM * BRAVERY * VALOR</b><BR><BR><i>A demon king? Only one? I
thought you said this would be difficult.<BR><BR>Now, stop rolling your eyes.
I'd expect more from someone who, not three days ago, threw himself at our feet,
crying and wailing that only the great hero Enikir the Bold could save the
kingdom from certain destruction.<BR><BR>Our plan is simple. Firstly, Animdar
the Arcane will magically seal the main gate. The demon king has 5,000 soldiers
at most. With that few, Animdar will have no trouble defeating them. Meanwhile,
I'll leap through the stained glass window set above the altar, land between the
demon king and the princess just before they complete their vows, and whisk Her
Highness away through the crowd. Cultoc will then shed his disguise as the evil
high priest's acolyte, splash the demon with the sacred waters of the virgin's
fountain, and banish the demon forever back to his infernal home.<BR><BR>If
things should go wrong? Don't worry, we'll improvise something.</i></center><BR>
