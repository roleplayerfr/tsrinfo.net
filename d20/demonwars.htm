<b>Before the Dactyl Awoke...</b><BR><BR>...the world of Corona was at peace.
Its people went about their business in serenity, and worries of goblin raids or
powrie attacks were seemingly a myth from days of yore. But when the Demon Dactyl
awoke, it unleashed a darkness unlike anything seen before.<BR><BR><b>A Classic
Story...</b><BR><BR>At its core, the story of <i>The DemonWars Saga</i> is one
of good vs. evil. This is your chance to take part in an epic struggle to
free the world of Corona from the grips of the evil Dactyl and its armies of
dread and chaos. You can join with the heroes of <i>The DemonWars Sage</i>,
Elbryan and Jelseponie, or venture forth on your own to battle the goblins, the
powries or even the darkness gripping the Abellican Order. There is more than
enough adventure for you. The question is, do you have what it takes to
survive?<BR><BR><b>...Set in a Very Different World</b><BR><BR>Corona may be a
world gripped by a classic struggle, but it is not your typical fantasy setting.
Spells are not bandied about by almost every adventurer and magical beasts do
not roam the lands like ducks in a shooting gallery. This world is gripped by
a struggle between ideals, where magic is rare and controlled by the Abellican
Order, whose brothers tirelessly track down those who wield that power without
its approval - even when used to battle the armies of the Dactyl!<BR><BR><center><b>
About The Authors</b></center><BR>A number of talented writers have collaborated
to bring <i>The DemonWars Saga</i> to you as a role-playing game, including
R.A. Salvatore and his sons, Bryan and Geno. We've also brought Thomas M. Reid,
a long-time friend and collaborator with R.A. Salvatore, on board to flesh out
the world of Corona and give it a life of its own.<BR><BR><center><b>The
DemonWars Saga</b></center><BR><i>The DemonWars Saga</i> is one that spans the
entire history of the world of Corona and pits the all the world's peoples
against the evil represented by the Demon Dactyl and its minions. Whether you
join Elbryan and Jilseponie Wyndon in their battle against the Dactyl, or go
back in time to join in the struggle shown in the CrossGen Comic, this
sourcebook will get you into the thick of the action!
