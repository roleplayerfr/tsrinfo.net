In the Last Age, the ancestral homeland of the elven people has become a
battleground. Armies of orcs, ogres, giant-men, and trolls mass in the
North, preparing to spill out of the Highhorns and lay waste to the
Veradeen, the snow-clad home of the Erunsil elves. In the east, trained
and disciplined orcish armies set out from Eisin, burning their way into
the fey wood along the mighty Felthera River. Standing defiant between
the bloody pincers of this assault is Caradul, the capital of the elven
nation and domain of Aradil, the Witch Queen. In the Night Kings' grand
campaign is successful, it could mean the end of organized resistance to
the Shadow in Eredane. The outcome is as yet undecided: Your heroes could
be the ones that save the elven nations... or doom them to defeat!<BR><BR>
