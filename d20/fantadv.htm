<i>You stealthily creep to the edge of the forest that boders Pixie
Creek. An unusual site greets you.<BR><BR>A giant, easily fiteen feet
tall, sits propped against a large boulder, wearing a grimace of pain
and hanging his left leg in the cool water of the creek. Standing
next to him is a gray-skinned satyr. He prods the giant with the butt
of his spear. "How the mighty have fallen," he mocks.<BR><BR>A thin
minotaur wearing deep red robes looks over at them. The minotaur sits
cross-legged on a broad flat rock, a large book open before him. As the
giant bellows, "I knew we should have brought me brother!" The minotaur
slams his book closed, clearly irritated.<BR><BR>Most baffling of all is
the creature that hovers in between, a bright green orb covered in eyes
and mouths. Creepy wisps of orange mist rise lazily from the floating
beast's eight mouths.</i><BR><BR>Another night of popcorn and dice,
another quaint village with a friendly tavern, and another dungeon to
map and explore. That's what your players think! To recover a fabled
gem at the behest of a village, the players must overcome their
expectations of the familiar trappings of fantasy role-playing. Like
the beautiful but deadly Red March in which it is set, twists and
surprises make this, <i>The Fantastic Adventure</i>.<BR><BR>Set in the
World of Erde, <i>The Fantastic Adventure</i> is a d20 System adventure
for 4-6 characters of levels 1-2. It weaves unique role-playing
oppurtunities with overland exploration and dungeon delving. DMs can
easily fit <i>The Fantastic Adventure</i> into their campaign, or use
it as the springboard for an epic campaign of high fantasy and grand
adventure in the World of Erde, After Winter Dark.<BR><BR>Requires the
use of the Dungeons & Dragons <a href="../3e/phb.htm">Player's
Handbook</a>, Third Edition, published by Wizards of the Coast.
