The city of Rahbaud has been at peace for generations. It is a prosperous
city, built on the backs of hard-work and guided by the hand of a
powerful overlord. The nobility lives in splendor, trading with local
areas to increase their own wealth, and capturing and breeding slaves
for the benefit of all.<BR><BR>Until a slave rebellion in the gladiator
pits threatens to destroy the prosperity and stability of this noble
city. In the service of Prince Sukhir Blackhammer, known as the Iron
Fist of Law, you have been enlisted to crush the rebellion. Your
duty is to destroy the slaves who threaten Rahbaud's security, and bring
the rebel leaders to to the justice of the Iron Fist.<BR><BR>There shall
be no mercy for those who dare to break with order. No refuge for the
murderers of peaceful merchants and nobility, for slaves who think to
buy their freedom with the blood of decent citizens.<BR><BR>An example
must be set, to keep the peace and force the other slaves back into
tranquility. If these treasonous serfs think to destroy generations of
work with some false hope of 'freedom', then the Prince of Rahbaud shall
give them their freedom....<BR><BR>In death.
