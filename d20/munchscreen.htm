Stealth - it's not just for players anymore.<BR><BR>Tired of your every
plan being exposed? Sick of not being able to fudge die rolls? Ever think
that all you really need is just a few more tables? Fear not, O wise
Master of Munchkins - salivation is at hand!<BR><BR>The <i>Munchkin Master's
Screen</i> contains everything you might need to run a <i>Munchkin</i>
game while hiding your true plans from your players. It's got <i>Munchkin
Cardboard Heroes</i> miniature figures. It has Jeff Tidball's brilliant
adventure, <i>The Village of Omelet</i>. And it has tables... <i>lots</i>
of tables. All the tables you could ever hope to use... and probably a
couple you hope <i>not</i> to.<BR><BR>This is the accessory you never knew
you needed... until now!<BR><BR><i>Special note to players:</i> Buying the
<i>Munchkin Master's Screen</i> for your DM earns you 10,000 XP. Really.
It says so inside.<BR><BR>The <i>Munchkin Master's Screen</i> requires at
least one copy of every <i>Munchkin</i> book for use. Even the ones we
haven't thought of yet. And the card games, too. It's just that good.<BR><BR>
