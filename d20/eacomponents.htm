<center>This volume presents the first serious study of the long-neglected
questions of why material components are used in spells, what logic governs
their use and whether or not it is possible to change them. Looking at the
typical components used in arcane spells and outlining the ket principles
on which they work. An exhaustive treatment of the standard arcane spells
is then provided which will inject new life and creativity into spellcasting.<BR><BR>
By daring to challenge the wisdom of the ages and use their own home-brewed
recipes rather than keeping slavishly to the old ones, players may gain
hitherto inaccessible levels of spell potency. Beware, however, for there
is a price; he who presumes to tamper with magic must be very sure of
himself, or he will cause an imbalance in the arcane forces be the first
to suffer for it. To the courageous mages who are willing to read on, this
is a risk well worth taking.<BR><BR><b>Inside You Will Find:</b><BR><BR><table cellspacing="5">
