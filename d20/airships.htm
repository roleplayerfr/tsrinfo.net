<b>Red Sky by Morning, Sailor take Warning...</b><BR><BR>While some choose to
sail the seas and oceans seeking trade, adventure, and fame, others are more
daring and sail the skies of their worlds. Discover the wonders of flight and

different forms. After all, no one race dominates the skies... save those that
need no ships and jealousy guard their skies. Like sea captains traversing

the aerial realms in the forms of dragons and other invisible dangers that pose
great risk to their airships.<BR><BR><b>Red Sky at Night, Sailor's Delight</b><BR><BR>
