<i><b>Between gods and mortals...</b><BR><BR>... stand a famous race of magical
beings. This first supplement for <a href="celticage.htm">CELTIC
AGE</a> examines one of the most beloved and revered classes of creatures in
Western culture: the fairy. THE LITTLE PEOPLE breaks them down by region,
offering a unique perspective on how fairies differed from place to place.
Stats for all the famous ones you know such as Oberon, Puck, and the Leprechaun
are included as well as a system for creating original fairies of your own. Not
some "bold, new vision" of the fey, these are the legends as they were perceived
by the people who thought fairies to be real.</i>
