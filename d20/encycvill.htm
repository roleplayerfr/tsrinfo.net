<b>Villains for All Heroes...</b><BR><BR>Heroes come in all sizes, shapes
and, most importantly, all levels of experience. Villains who could kill
a group of 2nd-level PCs wouldn't even last ten seconds against a party of
12th-level adventurers. Included in this book are dozens of different
villains of varying levels of challenge, giving you a wide range of bad
guys to throw at your heroes. From their initial steps out into the
world and throughout the course of their adventures, your players won't
know what hit them.<BR><BR><b>...and for All Occasions</b><BR><BR>In the
dozens of villians contained within these pages, you'll find bad guys
that your PCs can encounter in almost any region and circumstance. But
these are far more than just villains to be killed in one sitting. These
are individuals that your PCs can come across time and time again during
the course of their adventures. Perhaps one will hire those intrepid
adventurers of yours to retrieve a stolen artifact only to turn on them
years later. Or maybe one will just make it his life's goal to rid the
world of your PCs...<BR><BR><b>Make Life Easy on Yourself</b><BR><BR>The
<i>Encyclopedia of Villains</i> is here to aid you in your Game Mastering
duties. You don't always have the time to come up with a full
adventure. The army of villains contained in this book will give you
countless different adventure nuggets: just add PCs and go!<BR><BR>Visit

haunts the land in many different forms, not all of which are readily
identifiable. When a tribe of bugbears sets up camp in a forest, it's
easy to find them and end their reign of terror, but few villains are so
obvious. Most operate in secrecy, working through minions and allies to
achieve their goals unnoticed. The <i>Encyclopedia of Villains</i> is a
d20 System sourcebook that provides Game Masters a host of cunning
villains, ready to use and easily dropped into any fantasy setting.<BR><BR>
