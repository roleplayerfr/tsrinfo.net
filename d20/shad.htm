Welcome to Shadizar, City of Wickedness. Hopefully you wil have entered
of your own free will and not as a slave, either to a person or to a
vice. Regardless, few will have little or no idea of the scale of
debauchery and villainy that await you in Zomora's most infamous den of
iniquity. The Zamorians as a whole are seducers and harlots, torturers
and slavers, assassins and kidnappers, zealots and thieves. The denizens
of Shadizar, however, are even worse.<BR><BR>Drawing on the tantilising
hints of Robert E. Howard, as well as the writings of Roy Thomas and
Robert Jordan, Shadizar: City of Wickedness fully expands and explores,
in all its lurid detail, the city that has fascinated Conan fans for
decades.<BR><BR><b>THIS BOX CONTAINS:</b></center><BR>A 96 page Games
