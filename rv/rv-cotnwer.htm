<i>I wouldn't do that if I were you," warned the stranger in an oddly
irritated tone of voice, but the street thugs only laughed and struck
at him harder. He fell to the ground and curled into a ball...and then
the ball began to bulge and the stranger's clothing began to rip at the
seams, revealing the bristle of swiftly growing, shaggy hair.<BR><BR>
Children of the Night: Werebeasts</i> is the third book in a series that
brings to unlife the creature types detailed in the best-selling <i>Van
Richten's Guides</i>. Each of the creatures depicted herein carries its
own history, its own special curse, and its own mini-adventures that will
test the mettle and wits of novice and experienced adventurers alike.<BR><BR>
Some of the monsters that heroes will confront include the following:<BR><BR>
Meeka, a cat that became almost, but not quite, human.<BR>Professor
Arcanus, a collector of rather strange curiosities and artifacts.<BR>
Mother Fury, a woman who loves what she is and wants to share her
"gift."<BR>Henri Milton, an artist who isn't sure if art imitates life
or vice versa.<BR>Dr. Horstman, a scientist with a unique perception of
"progress."<BR><BR>These are the Children of the Night.<BR><BR>This
product was designed for use with the RAVENLOFT campaign setting, but
it can easily be adapted for use in any AD&D game world, or it can be
used by itself for an evening of terror.<BR><BR>For all character levels.
