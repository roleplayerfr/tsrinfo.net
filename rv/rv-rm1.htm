The Grand Conjunction has come to pass!<BR>As a result, the lords of
Ravenloft have broken through the Mists and escaped into the Prime
Material Plane. Bit by bit, monsters of the demiplane of dread are
following behind. And in the midst of all, Azalin the Lich and Strahd
von Zarovich play a power game - a game with deadly stakes, most
notably the player characters' lives. Unless the adventurers act
quickly, death will be the <i>least</i> of their troubles!<BR>This is
the second of two adventures that feature Azalin and Strahd von
Zarovich in their endless conflict. As a sequel to <a href="rv-rq3.htm"><i>
From the Shadows</i></a>, this module gives the player characters an
oppurtunity to atone for the evil they unwittingly caused as pawns of
Azalin. The culmination of a six-part series of adventures dealing
with the Grand Conjunction, <i>Roots of Evil</i> gives the player
characters an oppurtunity to literally save the universe (as well as
themselves!).<BR>Until the dark powers recapture the lords of Ravenloft,
no place is safe....
