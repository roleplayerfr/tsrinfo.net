The nightbound realm of Sithicus is dying! The grey forested crags
scarred by jagged rifts echo with the laments of the dying elven nation.
But the lord of the land sits uncaring on his blackened throne in the
charred castle of Negragaard, lost in ancient memories.<BR><BR>Through
his passion and hatred the nightmare haunted death knight, Lord Soth,
permitted catastrophe to befall his native world of Krynn. Now trapped
in the Realm of Terror, Soth has once more brough calamity to his home.
Abandoning rule of his twisted realm of Sithicus, Lord Soth has retreated
to a still more distorted domain: the mad fantasies of his own history.<BR><BR>
To save the land and themselves, the heroes must venture into

of a tormented darklord.<BR><BR>The history of the greatest villain of
the DragonLance Saga is at last revealed in the Realm of Terror. For
fans of DRAGONLANCE and RAVENLOFT adventures alike.<BR><BR>This grand
adventure is suited for four to six player characters of levels 4-6.
