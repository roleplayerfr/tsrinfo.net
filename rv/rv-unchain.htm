<b>You have no friends here</b><BR>What can you do when the Mists
deposit you in the city of Lekar? The militia is no better than a gang
of sadistic bullies, the citizens are more contagious than a fleet of
plague ships, and every foot of public space is covered with corpses of
criminals who committed no crime greater than struggling to survive in
the oppressive domain of Falkovnia.<BR><BR><b>Danger haunts your every
move</b><BR>A secret society of assassins, known only as the Ebon Fold,
has been hunting down visitos to Lekar and killing them in a most
grisly fashion; all that remains of the victims are dessicated husks
that crumble to ash when touched...and you are their next targets.<BR><BR><b>
There is no escape</b><BR>When everyone who has befriended you is
either dead or hunted by the authorities, you have no choice but to
fight back. But the Ebon Fold is a numberless horde whose leader holds
sway over death. How can you defeat enemies that won't stay in the
grave? They strike from the depths of darkness and steal your life...one
dagger stroke at a time.<BR><BR>This 64-page adventure can be played
independently, or as the opening challenge in the Grim Harvest series
that continues with <a href="rv-ascend.htm"><i>Death
Ascendant</i></a> and concludes with <a href="rv-req.htm"><i>
Requiem</i></a>. Inside this package is a poster map that fully
details all 10 levels of the chilling complex known as the Well of
Bones.<BR><BR><b>For three to six characters of levels 5-7</b>
