Rakshasa... For centuries, these diabolical creatures have hunted
humanity and preyed upon its flesh. Now the Mists have opened upon the
land of Sri Raji - home of dread Arijani, the rakshasa lord. He is the
mastermind behind a deadly game of illusion where plots lie within
plots that lie within plots. Wise player characters will trust neither
their eyes nor their wits, for nothing is as it seems in Sri Raji. The
rakshasa have laid their traps of intrigue for the unwary. This time,
the unwary are your characters.
