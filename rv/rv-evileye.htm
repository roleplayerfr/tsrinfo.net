Welcome to Invidia, where Vistani curses come to their terrible
fruition. As a young girl, Gabrielle Aderre was warned by her mother
never to have children: "A man, a babe, a home - these things can
never be for you, for tragedy will be the only result." Now the witch
Gabrielle has disobyed her mother and borne a child, an abomination
that could spell doom for Vistani everywhere. Gabrielle has learned
too late the truth of her mother's prophesy.<BR><BR><i>The Evil Eye</i>
is a series of six scenarios involving the Vistani and their most
hated nemesis, the legendary Dukkar. The adventurers uncover the
hidden secrets of Karina, the largest town in Invidia and home to the
most terrifying festival in Ravenloft. The heroes will arrive to see
a town in the throes of Carnival - a time when ghosts and madmen,
werewolves and gypsies all mingle under the waxing moon.<BR><BR>Inside
this package is a 64-page book containing all the information needed to
run <i>The Evil Eye</i>, plus a full-color mapsheet showing the land of
Invidia. <a href="rv-vrgvis.htm"><i>Van Richten's Guide
to the Vistani</i></a> and <a href="rv-vrgfnd.htm"><i>
Van Richten's Guide to Fiends</i></a> are helpful sources of information
to expand and enrich these adventures, but are not necessary for play.
