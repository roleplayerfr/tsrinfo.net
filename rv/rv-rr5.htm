Beware the darkness, for it is alive with the dead! Now, the nights of
Ravenloft are more horrifying than ever. You'll find out why in the
pages within.<BR>Follow Dr. Rudolph Van Richten, Ravenloft's leading
authority on the supernatural, as he reveals how to hunt the ghosts
that lurk in the blackest shadows of midnight. For countless years,
Van Richten has traveled the misty roads of Ravenloft on a mission to
destroy the undead wherever they might be. Now, your characters can
join him on his courageous quest.<BR>Dr. Van Richten tells all that he
has discovered about the incorporeal undead. He explains their origins,
the passions that draw them back from beyond the grave, and the
horrible powers bestowed upon them in unlife. In addition, he offers
his wise counsel on the ways in which these fiends can be stalked,
confronted, and destroyed.<BR>Be careful, for these ghosts are not
simple, moaning spirits of darkest night. These are the ghosts of
Ravenloft.<BR><BR><center><b>96 pages - Recommended for All Character
