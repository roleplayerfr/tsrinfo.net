In the caverns, crypts, and chasms of Ravenloft lie mummies and other
horrors for whom sleep is a natural state. These are the ancient dead.
Dreams of love, glory, and wealth subdue them through the ages, and
time grows meaningless - until the greedy or foolish disturb their rest.
When the ancient dead rise and walk again, evil spreads before them and
destruction lies in their wake.<BR>In the land of mists, the ancient
dead are unique monstrosities of astonishing power, capable of rising
again and again despite the efforts of the mightiest heroes. Only
Rudolph van Richten, Ravenloft's greatest foe of darkness, has
accrued the knowledge necessary to stop them. Within this treatise the
doctor classifies these complex creatures, defines their common
characteristics, and speculates upon their salient abilities. It may
be impossible to destroy the ancient dead, but with persistence, good
fortune, and Van Richten's wise counsel, one might send them back to
their dreams....<BR><center><b>96 pages - Recommended for All Character
