Just ahead, a pale, undefined figure beckons. A clammy chill hangs
heavily in the air. Unseen fingers tangle in the hair of a whimpering
victim as a low moan pulses all around and stretches into a waiting
silence.<BR><BR>Children of the Night: Ghosts</i> details thirteen
horrifying and tragic beings that test the fear threshold of even the
staunchest ghost hunter. The restless spirits depicted herein will
force heroes to solve conundrums or look at ghosts in a new light.
Every creature presented in this book has its own history, personality,
and powers.<BR><BR>Some of the haunts that adventurers will confront
include the following:<BR><BR>Vlana Waldershen, a half-Vistani ghost
whose rage knows no bounds.<BR><BR>Susasnnah Joson, a lonely geist who
endlessly searches for her true love.<BR><BR>The Ghost Cat, a monstrous
being that draws tainted victims further onto the path of evil.<BR><BR>
Nikolai Melentha, a child ghost who becomes what he hates most while
protecting the defenseless.<BR><BR>These are the Children of the Night.<BR><BR>
<i>Children of the Night: Ghosts</i> is the second book in a series that
brings to unlife the creature types detailed in the best-selling <i>Van
Richten's Guides</i>. Each volume offers biographies of distinct and
monstrous personalities easily added to any game; short adventures
featuring each nemesis, which can stand alone or form a mini-campaign;
unique ways to fight each foe; and adventure hooks for using them in
future scenarios.<BR><BR>For all character levels.
