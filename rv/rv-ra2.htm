<b>Horrible hauntings, cruel curses, dark secrets...this is no pleasure
cruise!</b><BR><BR>The mists of Ravenloft know no boundaries and
observe no rules. One way or another, they always get what they want -
this time with some help from a cursed captain and his ship. Player
characters boarding an innocent-looking ship will soon find themselves
aboard a haunted vessel, destined for an island inhabited by a new form
of undead creatures. But that's not the end of the horror - an evil
necromancer lies at the root of the evil on the island. The battle
isn't over until he's been defeated!<BR><i>Ship of Horror</i> is an
adventure set in Ravenloft with two beginnings: one for PCs already in
Ravenloft, and one for DMs looking for a way to push his PCs into
Ravenloft from other worlds. The adventure includes three new monsters,
new spells, and several handouts ready for distribution to players.
<i>Ship of Horror</i> is an adventure for four to six players of levels
8-10 looking for grisly chills and thrills!
