In the bitter cold of a land mired in eternal winter, hunters take the
shape of wolves to better kill their prey. They stalk the snow-filled
forests on paws of deadly silence. Powerful and swift, these evil
shapechangers roam the land at will, murdering those who oppose them and
plundering the weak. At the head of this pack paces the great Black
Wolf of the wood. Is this murderous beast the underling of Gregor
Zolnik, the boyar who rules this waste? Seeking to extend his conquests
by any means he can, Gregor has cowed the land of Vorostokov by
relying on ruthless strength and savagery. Are your player characters
clever enough to survive against villains who are stronger, faster,
and fiercer than any they've ever encountered? The Black Wolf awaits
your answer in the biting cold....
