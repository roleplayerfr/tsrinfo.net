Within this volume are 16 dark lords and ladies, each a prisoner of
Ravenloft. Some are new to the setting, yet all may seem hauntingly
familiar, for they have been lurking at the edge of your nightmares,
waiting for the chance to emerge in your campaigns.<BR><BR>The Headless
Horseman, the Phantom Lover, the Vampire Panther - these and other
malignant forces await. You'll read ghastly tales of their past, and
grim accounts of their present. You'll visit their dark domains and
tour the horrid sites portrayed in 10 full-page maps.<BR><BR>The shadows
are lengthening; the air is growing chill. The Darklords are calling.
Their voices are carried by the Mists of Ravenloft, and you have little
choice but to answer.<BR><BR><center><b>96 pages - Recommended for
