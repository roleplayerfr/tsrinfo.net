<i>There are realms and realms incomprehensible to the puny mortals who
dwell within this cage that they term the Land of the Mists!<BR></i>-The
Madrigorian, <i>Book I, Chapter I</i><BR><BR>Fiends have come forth
from the Abyss and into Ravenloft! Masters of deception and manipulation,
these ancient evil beings stalk the Lands, roaming freely in pursuit of
their foul ends, and warping the very Land around them to suit their
needs.<BR><BR>Dr. Rudolph Van Richten has set himself on their trail
and presents here his preliminary findings and theories on these beings
from places of unimaginable horror.<BR><BR>Dr. Van Richten exposes the
nature, origin, stengths and weaknesses of the Fiend, and how it reaches
the Land of the Mists. He explores the character of these beings, and
their connections to the people and the Land itself. In the ultimate
irony, these awesome creatures are as trapped by the Land as any
mortal, seduced by prospects of power and glory!<BR><BR>Beware the Fiend!
For those caught in the web of a Fiendish plot, nothing is as it seems.
To defeat a Fiend, a quick wit and a strong heart are more important
than a strong arm or flashing blade!<BR><center><b>96 pages - Recommended
