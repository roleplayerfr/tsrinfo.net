<i>From the depths of antiquity, he arises....<BR>Trapped in a mockery
of his former kingdom, he broods....<BR>In hatred and spite against
the one who betrayed him, he schemes....<BR><BR>The other lords of
Ravenloft may possess horrific power...<BR>but Vecna is a god.<BR><BR>

</i>Vecna Reborn<i> takes brave heroes into the dark, oppressed domain
of Tor Gorak, where Kas whips his subjects into submission to serve in
his never-ending war against Vecna and Cavitius, a realm in the grip of
ancient magic and malevolent undeath. The heroes must struggle to stop
arcane rituals, insane cultists, and monstrous abominations from
granting Vecna, the Chained God, the power to fulfill his dark dreams.
</i>Vecna Reborn<i> presents a terrifying tale of betrayal, madness, and
sorcery that may tear apart the Demiplane of Dread itself.</i>
