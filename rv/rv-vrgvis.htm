Over three decades ago, the only child of Dr. Rudolph van Richten was
stolen by Vistani thieves and sold to a vampire. The doctor's efforts
to rescue his son and then avenge himself upon that vampire led to a
dark new career fighting the terrifying monsters in the Deminplane of
Dread. Now, the sage of Ravenloft turns his attention to the very
people who made him what he is today.<BR><BR>In spite of his deepest
fears and hatred, Van Richten has passed among the Vistani - the
nomads of the Mists - and he has learned much. Within this book he
describes Vistani legends, their everyday life, abilities common to all
of them, and some of the fell powers possessed - fortunately - by only
a few. Van Richten also identifies each of the Vistani tribes, their
strange and special powers, and their habits and beliefs.<BR><BR>In
addition, an appendix is provided for the generation of <i>Vistani</i>
player-characters.<BR><center><b>96 pages - Recommended for All
