Welcome to the realm of dread. It is a land of dark terror, treachery,
and intrigue. The breathtaking splendor of the days pales against the
horrors of the nights, when dead things rise and your darkest fears
come true. And this is only the beginning.<BR><BR>And now Ravenloft
becomes much, much darker. These new islands are destined to terrify
even the bravest hero, and they are...dying to claim you. Visit nine
lands where time is measured in pounding hearbeats, where foul lords
perpetuate their evil crimes amid the putrid odor of decay. From
I'Cath and Saragoss to Timor and Pharazia, read accounts of the islands
are dare to view their images on a full-color, poster map.<BR><BR>Beware
the Mists of Ravenloft. Fear them, but respect them, too, for they
are the only barrier between you and the wickedness that slumbers in
your deepest nightmares.<BR><BR><center><b>96 pages - Recommended for
