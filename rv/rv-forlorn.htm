<center><b>Time Is Meaningless in Castle Tristenoira</b></center><BR><i>
Forlorn has long remained hidden in the shadows of notorious Barovia
and Kartakass, yet the tiniest domain in the lands of the core is nearly
as old as Ravenloft itself. This land is sick with evil, a twisted
mockery of the place it once was. It is filled with creatures of
despair who were drawn into the demiplane of dread....<BR>Within Castle
Tristenoira lies oblivion. The crumbling keep slips in and out of time,
carrying its unwary explorers across the centuries, where they may be
abandoned to the cold winds of eternity - and to the ghosts in the
castle! Spirits both innocent and guilty haunt the timeless passages,
whispering tales of murder and vengeance. Escape is for the lucky...or
the hopelessly mad.</i><BR><BR>The <i>Castles Forlorn</i> boxed
adventure set provides the DUNGEON MASTER with a rich and complex
domain in which to set a campaign of any size and duration. It includes
a 96-page sourcebook, <i>The Weeping Land</i>, which reveals the complete
history of the domain and the strange and terrible lord who rules over
it. Descriptions of the living and dead who call this lonely land home
abound, as do details of the forbidding Tristenoira castle, where
adventures may spend an evening or an age.<BR>After learning Forlorn's
history of sorrow, the DM can lead player characters into <i>Melancholy
Meetings</i>, a 32-page collection of encounters that provide adventure
in every corner of the domain. Finally, only <i>Eve of Sorrows</i>
remains, which is a 32-page assortment of mysteries and nightmares
within the castle itself.<BR>This deluxe boxed adventure set completes
the portrait of Forlorn with a highly detailed, double-sided poster
map of the castle, a poster map of the domain, and a special wall
poster created by award-winning artist Robh Ruppel - all in full color.
