<center><b>It's just a bad dream - a very bad dream....</b></center><BR>
Beware the night, for sleep provides another path to the Demiplane of
Dread. In the unique domain called the Nightmare Lands, darkness offers
not blissful slumber, but ultimate terror. Heroes enter this realm at
the bidding of the night, drawn from their dreaming bodies and captured
by an enigmatic figure known only as the Nightmare Man. Trapped in this
region of psychological fear, heroes face their worst nightmare in
strange, surrealistic terrain. If they escape the treacherous clutches
of dark slumber, they'll be safe - at least until the next time sleep
overtakes them....<BR><BR>This boxed set contains everything necessary
