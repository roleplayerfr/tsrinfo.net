<b>They lurk in the shadows.<BR>The linger in your dreams.<BR>They
strike in the darkness.</b><BR><BR>They are the foul and horrible
creatures that dwell in Ravenloft, the Demiplane of Dread, and they are
waiting for you. From the dream-stalking bastellus to the body-snatching
doppleganger plant, this horrific tome contains a great assortment of
creatures that will haunt the nightmares of player characters for years
to come. In addition, this book presents over 20 unique creatures,
including the living brain of Rudolph Von Aubrecker and the dreaded
night hag Styrx, all of whom are perfect for use as master villains and
NPCs.<BR><BR>TSR is proud to present this compilation of diabolical
beings from the first two MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM appendices dedicated to
the RAVENLOFT campaign setting. First released in 1991 and 1993, these
collections have been unavailable for some time, but always in demand.
Now they're back - at a price that's lower than the combined price of
the two earlier products. No RAVENLOFT campaign is complete without
this book.<BR><BR><b>The time has come to return to your nightmares.</b>
