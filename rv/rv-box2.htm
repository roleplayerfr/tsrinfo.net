<center><b>Terror in the Land of Mists</b></center><BR><i>In the year
351 of the Barovian calendar, Strahd von Zarovich made a pact with
Death - a pact that sealed his fate and created a land of nightmares
known as Ravenloft. Other lords of darkness have embraced the
Demiplane of Dread as their own, and woe to heroes who wander there.
Creatures of the night prey freely upon the living in this land, and day
is but a prelude to another night of horror.</i><BR><BR>This new edition
of the RAVENLOFT game combines the original <a href="rv-box.htm"><i>
