There is a black terror that amasses great authority in the farthest
reaches of Ravenloft, quietly insinuating its sway upon the land like
a creeping poison: Its name is <i>lich</i>.<BR>Until now, vampires have
been the undisputed masters of darkness, but the sheer genius of the lich
(coupled with its immortal quest for ever more powerful magic) has
proven to be a malevolent threat to the cause of Goodness. Liches were
once all-powerful wizards in life, yet they have sacrificed everything
to leap beyond the bounds of humanity and acquire unspeakable necromantic
mastery.<BR>In the face of such might and malice, there appears to be
but one hope:<BR>Dr. Rudolph Van Richten, scholar and bane to all
creatures of the night, has once again picked up quill and parchment -
this time to expose this dreaded monster's darkest secrets! Within
these pages the reader will learn of the lich's origins, its powers, its
lair, and even its very psychological makeup as well as the keys to a
successful hunt and termination. Deadly new minions and unique lich
magicks are also brough to the fore.<BR>Take back the night, all ye of
courageous heart and keen blade! With each chime of the clock, the
lich seeks to complete another of its diabolical schemes. Unchecked,
the monster will obliterate the light of day, and Ravenloft is already
much too dark....<BR><center><b>96 pages - Recommended for All
