- Vistani Proverb<BR><BR>Decades ago, the fair land of Avonleigh was
guarded by an order of paladins known as the Circle. One stormy night,
a wizard named Morgoroth came to seek refuge with them.<BR><BR>But, all
was not as it seemed! Morogoroth was no mere wizard; he was a
necromancer on the run from a knightly brotherhood that had vowed to
see him destroyed! When fate revealed his past, he betrayed the Circle
and fled.<BR><BR>Can your heroes complete the crusade that destroyed
the Circle? Can they learn the secrets of Morgoroth's power before the
necromancer destroys them? Accept the quest if you dare....<BR><BR><i>
A Light in the Belfry</i> is the first RAVENLOFT adventure to feature
an Interactive Audio CD. As players explore Morgoroth's dreadfilled
manor, they will actually hear the lamentations of tortured spirts, the
clash of swords and the thunderous roar of magic. With almost 100
tracks of dialogue, sound effects and mood music, TSR's Interactive
Audio CD Adventures add a new dimension to the horror of Ravenloft.
