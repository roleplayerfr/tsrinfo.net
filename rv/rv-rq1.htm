In a rain-soaked graveyard, a small group of men stands round a coffin
bound with heavy chains. "We are here to mourn the passing of Jean de
Cardeau," intones the village priest. "Let us pray that his rest is
eternal, and that he never returns."<BR>As the pallbearers life the
coffin, something scrapes on the wood from inside. Quickly and without
emotion, the attendants slide the casket into a crypt. Then they seal
the door and flee. Behind them, unheard, a dull thudding begins,
growing louder with the onset of twilight. There can be no peace for
those who linger in the earthly realm after death. And there can be
no sanctuary on the Night of the Walking Dead!<BR><BR>Set in a
zombie-infested swampland, <i>Night of the Walking Dead</i> is an
ideal first-time RAVENLOFT adventure. Players must unravel the mystery
behind a string of murders and disappearances in a village plagued by
ambulant undead - and all is not as simple as it seems!<BR>The hour of
fear is upon us. Are you ready to face the demiplane of dread?<BR>For
4 to 6 players, levels 1 to 3.
