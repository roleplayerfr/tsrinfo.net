<i>...by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull
yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive
motion agitated its limbs.<BR>-</i>Mary Shelley, <i>Frankenstein</i><BR><BR>
Armed with satchel and saw, the creator slips into the night. He seeks
the freshly dug grave and the unguarded morgue, selecting each body
part with care. In the twilight before dawn, he tailors a perfect form,
seeing no fault in the livid flesh or the crude black stitching. Creating
a new life is his sole obsession - yet the thing he creates brings
only misery and death.<BR>The golems of Ravenloft boast powers unseen
in other realms, for they are shaped by the demiplane's mysterious
forces. Join Dr. Van Richten as he exposes the evil that is the
Created. Learn his theories on construction and animation, and discover
his hard-won notes on the golem's phenomenal strength. Heed well his
sage advice, for whether their parts are human or otherwise, the
Created are cunning and relentless foes, rising again and again from
apparent death. Only with the knowledge herein can a hunter utterly
destroy such a monster, until nothing but ashes and nightmares remain.<BR><center>
