<i>I know now the shape of madness, of ravening insanity, and it is me!
I dread the waxing of the moon, yet how can I flee from time itself?
The hour of transformation is at hand, and my heart surges in bloodlust!</i><BR>
- The Cry of a Werewolf<BR><BR>Werebeasts: men and women who assume the
shape of animals. In this volume, Dr. Rudolph Van Richten - Ravenloft's
eminent expert on the horrific - exposes the truth about their
ravenous kind. For years, Van Richten has doggedly pursued these
creatures. More than once, the hunter became the hunted, yet lived to
tell the tale. Now Van Richten reveals the secrets of his survival.<BR><BR>
Discover the werebeasts' many forms, from the common to the bizarre.
Read how they live, lust, and multiply, spreading their affliction
among the innocent. Learn to see through their human facade, and how
to follow their beastly spoor. Finally, discover what it <i>really</i>
takes to cure lycanthropy in Ravenloft. For upon the demiplane of
dread, few adventurers can avoid the werebeast's fang forever....<BR><BR><center><b>
