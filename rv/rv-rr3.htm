At last some means of combatting the ultimate undead, vampires, have
found their way into print. Within these pages, Dr. Rudolph Van Richten
shares his vast background as one of Ravenloft's most formidable lore
masters and vampire hunters. Decades of research and experience have
been compiled into discussions which define the very nature of those
"kings of the undead," and help put them at a disadvantage to mortals,
whom they consider to be "mere cattle."<BR>Dr. Van Richten has
detailed vampiric powers, weaknesses, feeding and sleeping habits, even
their varied relationships with others of their own kind. Old myths
are dispelled, new facts are uncovered, and the experiences of both
vampires and those you hunt them are recorded for your safety and
enlightenment.<BR>Quickly! Soon the sun sets and the dead will rise!
The vampires of Ravenloft know no mercy, and you must be prepared before
the darkness engulfs you.<BR><BR><center><b>96 pages - Recommended for
