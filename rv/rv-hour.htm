gruesome precision - and always at midnight.<BR>A party of brave
adventurers witnesses the most recent of these brutal murders. Now that
they've seen the killer's face, they're sure to be his next targets.<BR>
Who can be trusted in this city where the residents are not what they
appear to be?<BR>Those who dare to track the killer will find strange
allies - and even stranger enemies. The adventurers must investigate
the ancient mystery behind the murders that take place when the clock
