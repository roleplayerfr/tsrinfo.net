<i>There are some things that mere mortals were never meant to know....</i><BR><BR>
In the domain of Lamordia, Doctor Victor Mordenheim created Adam -
cobbling the creature together from parts of human corpses. Now, years
later, Adam wants revenge. Adam wants Elise, Victor's wife. Adam wants
Victor <i>dead</i>.<BR><BR>The player characters' ship founders on the
coast of the domain of Lamordia. A vicious storm leaves them washed
ashore, cold and hungry on the ice-bound Isle of Agony.... Then the
terror begins.<BR><BR>The adventurers embark on a journey of fear that
leads from certain doom on the frozen island to a strange new life at
Schloss Mordenheim. To return home they must challenge Adam himself
and discover a portal - a gate that <i>might</i> lead homeward.<BR><BR><i>
Adam's Wrath</i> is intended for a party of four to eight characters of
5th to 7th level. Carefully designed to allow a DUNGEON MASTER to launch
from any campaign world or Ravenloft domain, <i>Adam's Wrath</i> is an
adventure your characters will never forget - if they survive!
