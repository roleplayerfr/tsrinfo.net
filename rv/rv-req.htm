<center><b>"At midnight everyone will die..."</b></center><BR>Azalin
the lich lord is launching another diabolic plan. He has allied himself
with the entity known as Death, and together they plan to raze the
domain of Darkon. From the ashes of this once-mighty land will rise a
new domain - Necropolis, the land of the dead!<BR>For the citizens of
Darkon, death has been an everyday companion, and sometimes a
yearned-for end to suffering. However, now the cold comfort of the
grave is forever denied these good men and women as they find themselves
walking the land after their breath has left them.<BR>Heroes have
always considered the undead to be mere monsters, legions of mindless
evil to be slain with no second though. Now the heroes will learn the
agony of actually being one of the living dead. They become the
monsters, and the entire world becomes their enemy.<BR><BR>This boxed
set contains everything necessary to take your characters beyond
death's veil and into the shadowy world of unlife, including:<BR><BR><b>
Requiem:</b> 96 pages of rules for the generation and play of undead
player characters as well as tips for Dungeon Masters. This book
details 12 different types of creatures that characters can become
after death, as well as dozens of powers and weaknesses they may possess.<BR><BR><b>
Necropolis:</b> 32 pages covering the new domain of Necropolis.
Although little has changed physically in the former domain of Darkon,
the people, animals, plants, and even the land itself have been infused
with the power of the new demilord, Death.<BR><BR><b>Death Triumphant:</b>
A 64-page adventure that puts the heroes in the middle of Lord Azalin's
ultimate scheme to escape from Ravenloft. <i>Death Triumphant</i> can
be played as a stand-alone adventure or as the final chapter in the
Grim Harvest series.<BR><BR><b>Poster Map:</b> One two-sided, full-color
map detailing the headquarters of Azalin's secret police and the new
domain of Necropolis.<BR><BR><b>For three to six characters of levels
