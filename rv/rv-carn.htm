<center>Freak show or sanctuary?<BR><BR>It's all a matter of perspective<BR>
when you're at Carnival.</center><BR>Carnival offers a glimpse of
abnormal and unnatural things most genteel folk never talk about, much
less see. This carnival is not a simple sideshow, though, and its
performers are far more than freaks on display. Carnival is a
wandering haven for those who have no place else to go - including
adventurers who made enemies of the wrong people. Under the protection
of the mysterious mistress Isolde, it offers refuge to those rejected
by the world. Outcasts and lost souls of all kinds can find solace
here, and sometimes even a second chance at life...but nothing at
Carnival comes without a price.<BR><BR>This accessory draws back the
curtain on dark secrets that will enrich any AD&D campaign with a
touch of the bizarre and horrific. Included are over a dozen richly
detailed nonplayer characters, details on "the price" that Carnival
exacts from those who travel with it, and story seeds to lure
unsuspecting heroes into a web of mystery and trickery.
