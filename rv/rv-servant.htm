Young Bryonna has been judged guilty of consorting with the dark forces
of Tepest, and now she will burn at the stake for it. The Inquisitors,
priests whose zealousness sometimes stirs whispers of doubt among the
people, have condemned her with all the surety that comes with their
"holy" power.<BR><BR>Heroes of integrity and justice are needed to ferret
out the truth. To succeed, they must travel a perilous path that winds
through the labyrinthine tunnels of Mount Lament and leads them to the
dreaded Hags of Tepest and Tristessa the banshee. Worse still, they
must ultimately face the mysterious Prince of Shadows, who manipulates
the denizens of the domain for his own evil purposes. When to stand
fast? When to run? Only those who survive can say.<BR><BR><i>Servants
of Darkness</i> is a stand-alone adventure that can also lead the party
to investigate the misty chasm at the center of the Demiplane's Core in
