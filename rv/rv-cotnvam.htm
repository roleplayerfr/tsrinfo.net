<b>Behold the many faces of mankind's darkest enemy</b><BR><BR>Twin
puncture wounds mark the kiss of the nosferatu. Blood trickles with
the slow crawl of despair. A shadow lingers, black against black.
Chill mist clings damply to every surface, and the echo of an anguished
shriek still hangs in the air....<BR><BR><i>Vampires</i> introduces 13
unique and terrifying villains of horrific proportions. Each one
challenges vampire hunters to rethink common perceptions of these foes -
for these are no ordinary undead. Each creature presented in this
book is a unique individual with its own history, personality, and
powers.<BR><BR>The lords of the night that adventurers will meet
include:<BR>Jander Sunstar, one of the oldest vampires in the Land of
Mists.<BR>Myxitzajal, a seagoing monster with a taste for fishermen.<BR>
Lady Adeline, an elf vampire who seeks out light rather than hiding
from it.<BR>Lyssa von Zarovich, who covets the power of her great-uncle
Strahd.<BR>And many more!<BR><BR><b>These are the Children of the Night</b><BR><BR>
<i>Children of the Night: Vampires</i> is the first book in a new series
that brings to unlife the creature types treated in the best-selling
<i>Van Richten's Guides</i>. Each volume offers biographies of distinct
and monstrous villains easily added to any game; short adventures
featuring each nemesis, which can stand alone or form a mini-campaign;
unique ways to fight each foe; and adventure hooks for using them as
recurring villains.<BR><BR>For all character levels.
