<b>Old soldiers never die...</b><BR>
For more than three decades, Dr. Rudolph van Richten stood against the
forces of darkness, and hunted their servants in the far corners of the
land of Mists. Now he had thought his long battle over, had thought he
could spend his declining years in quiet enjoyment with old friends.<BR><BR>
<b>But for some, a tragic end is inevitable.</b><BR>Dark forces have
been gathering in the Mists. Their objective is to see Ravenloft's
foremost expert on the supernatural destroyed, shattered in spirit as
well as in body. From the crumbling edifice of Van Richten's childhood
home, an enemy long thought vanquished spins a web of powerful evils
and lost souls, drawing Van Richten to his doom. And then a group of
heroes gets trapped in the web as well....<BR><BR><b>Witness the
