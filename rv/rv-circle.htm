The Mists of Ravenloft lead to G'Henna, land of famine and zealous
devotion to Yagno Petronova, high priest of the Beast-God, Zhakata. In
the cities of G'Henna, worshippers starve themselves to prove their
faith; in the Outlands, twisted mongrelmen struggle to survive in a land
of unforgiving windstorms and bleak plains.<BR><BR>No domain in the
Demiplane of Dread has been in greater need of change - and the subtle
agents of the <i>Circle of Darkness</i> wish for nothing less than the
overthrow of their oppressive leader and create a new order lead by
Zhakata himself.<BR><BR>They should be careful what they wish for.<BR><BR>
<i>Circle of Darkness</i> is a dangerous adventure for heroes willing
to face not only the Dark Lord of G'Henna, but also the greater evil
which threatens to overcome him. The fate of an entire domain is in
the heroes' hands!<BR><BR>For 4 to 6 characters of levels 5 to 7.
