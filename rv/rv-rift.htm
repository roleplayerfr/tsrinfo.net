For many years folk have gazed into the churning black vapors of the
Shadow Rift and wondered at the horrors that might lie within. Some
have speculated that it might be a realm of the doomed, where tortured
spirits suffer the hours of eternity. Others have speculated that it
might be an empty domain, waiting for the arrival of a master who is
