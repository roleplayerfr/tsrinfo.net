<b>Death Is in the Cards</b><BR>The remnants of Ebon Fold are cutting
a deadly path through the Falkovian countryside, draining travelers of
their life force and leaving withered corpses in their wake. Hot on
their trail, you come across the sole survivor of one of these deadly
attacks, a young vistani man with an extraordinary skill for
fortune-telling. His <i>tarokka</i> deck helps close the gap between
you and the assassins. Together you follow the trail through Darkon,
the dark domain of the lich lord Azalin, to the city of Nartok.<BR><BR><b>
With an Unholy Alliance...</b><BR>Something very strange is happening
in Nartok. The killers enter the Temple of Eternal Order and don't
come out. It seems that the state relgion of Darkon is giving succor
to these assassins. To make matters more confusing, the Kargat, the
domain's secret police, has put aside its feud with the Eternal Order
and has a large contingent staying at the temple as well. These
three organizations working together bodes ill for the residents of
Nartok.<BR><BR><b>...And Schemes Within Infernal Schemes</b><BR>Great
amounts of life energy are being collected for some foul purpose, although
no one seems to know what exactly it is. The <i>tarokka</i> cards
provide only mysterious glimpses of the future - a future in which a
powerful evil sweeps the land and Death walks the world. Can you
discover the truth of what is happening in the temple in time to avert
the disaster predicted by the cards?<BR><BR><i>Death Ascendant</i> is a
full-length adventure that can be run as a stand-alone scenario or as
the second part in the Grim Harvest series. It contains a 64-page
adventure booklet plus a full-color poster map detailing the Temple of
the Eternal Order.<BR><BR><b>For three to six characters of levels
