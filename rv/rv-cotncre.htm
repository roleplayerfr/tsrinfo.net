<i>The Whole Is Greater Than the Sum of the Parts</i><BR><BR>Within
these pages lie the stories of 13 madmen and their singular creations.
Some are flesh and blood, others glass or wax, even metal or mist.
Whatever their makeup, each has the will to live - and sometimes that
means needing to kill. They are more than just golems. They are the
Created. And they are ready to make your acquaintance.<BR><BR>Among
those lurking inside:<BR><BR>The Chaperone, a bestial companion with
grave defects.<BR>Automatic Man, a corroded "butler" entombed in
rubble, eager to serve up terror anew.<BR>Angelique, a perfect beauty
with an imperfect past, terrified by the "killer within."<BR>Dr.
Bollenbach, a surgeon who know the many faces of death - and who would
like you to meet them.<BR><BR><i>Children of the Night: The Created</i>
is the fourth volume in a series that celebrates the horrors detailed
in the best-selling <i>Van Richten's Monster Hunter's Compendiums</i>.
Each of the creatures in this book is introduced through a complete
story describing its origin, powers, and personality, as well as a
short adventure.<BR><BR>While these monsters are designed for the
RAVENLOFT campaign setting, they can be unleashed in any AD&D game
world. Each mini-adventure can serve as a diversion from regular play,
a special "evening of terror," or become part of your ongoing horror
campaign.<BR><BR>For all character levels.
