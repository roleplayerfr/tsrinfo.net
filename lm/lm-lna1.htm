<i>Thieves of Lakhmar</i> is a companion volume to the AD&D game
accessory, <a href="lm-coa1.htm"><i>Lankhmar, City of
Adventure</i></a> and further enhances the exciting, dark, and
dangerous setting of that Nehwonian city. <i>Thieves of Lakhmar</i> is
the definitive sourcebook for any and all who are interested in the
Thieves' Guild, perhaps the most powerful single guild or organization
in Lankhmar. Existing knowledge on every aspect of the Thieves' Guild
(its operations, principal officers, members, history, hidden agendas,
the famed Thieves' House) as well as pertinent information on the
guild's principal nemeses in Lankhmar is contained in these pages.
Additional data on Lankhmart government and justice and settings for
further adventures in the City of the Black Toga are here also. Indeed,
this tome is a wealth of information for any who earn their livings in
Lankhmar by "procuring" others' wealth - and for those who may cross
or fight them.
