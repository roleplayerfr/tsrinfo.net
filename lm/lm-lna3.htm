Your party is sent on a relatively easy mission: Escort the Prince of
Lankhmar home from his school in Ilthmar. Naturally, the simplicity
of the mission does not last for long. The prince is kidnapped and
held for ransom! What began as a bread and butter request quickly
turns into life and death for the prince - and the party! Who is the
mysterious kidnapper, and what motive does he have other than material
gains? Beware this Darkwolf, for he might be more than he seems. Do
not be fooled, adventurers, into thinking you can easily keep your
promise to return the Prince of Lankhmar!
