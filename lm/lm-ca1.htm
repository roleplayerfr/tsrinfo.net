LANKHMAR...city of thieves, city of the night, city of adventure. Once
again, a dark bargain has been struck, and a murder committed in a dark
and narrow street. An ancient book, an expedition through the Sinking
Lands, and a strange treasure brought back to the city were enough to
trigger the envy of the rich and the powerful.<BR>Deadly plots are
conceived, concocted, and brewed like ancient poisons. In the dead of
the night stalks the might of a temple, in the wake of a secret and
arcane intrigue.<BR>Where the path of adventure meets terrible creatures
of the night and the envy of so many, will you be able to survive the
tricks and dangers of ancient LANKHMAR? Use your wits and ingenuity
and perhaps with some luck your success might overshadow the might of
the city's two fabled heroes, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser.<BR><BR>This
8th to 12th level adventure is designed for the <a href="lm-coa1.htm">
LANKHMAR City of Adventure</a> setting, and the ADVANCED DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game. It cannot be played without the <a href="lm-coa1.htm">
LANKHMAR City of Adventure</a> booklet or the AD&D rules published by
