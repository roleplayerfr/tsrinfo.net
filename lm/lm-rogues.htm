Looking to match steel and strength with the Black Knight, a forbidding
armored figure new to Lankhmar? He's in here. Need to find out about the
Vermin Catchers or the crafty Beggars' Guild? Look inside for all the
information you'll need to catch them. Are you looking for new thrills in
your City of Lankhmar campaign? Is so, this is the book for you.<BR><BR><i>
Rogues in Lankhmar</i> is the first of a series of supplements that expand
the information on the city of Lankhmar. This initial product covers the
Plaza and Tenderloin Districts, a favorite place for FAFHRD and the GRAY
MOUSER in the city and an area notorious for tavern brawls, back street
thievery, and all sorts of excitement and danger. <i>Rogues in Lankhmar</i>
provides Dungeon Masters with new places detailed and ready for adventure,
new guilds and groups vying for power in Lankhmar's shadowed streets, and
many new nonplayer characters for allies and enemies galore.<BR><BR>
Whether it's sunset at the Plaza of Dark Delights or sunrise at the End
Gate, the adventure never stops in Lankhmar!<BR><BR><center>Suitable for
all levels of play.</center>
