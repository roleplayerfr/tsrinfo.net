It is the year of the Zodac-no-Kara, the year of the wizards' champions.
Once every 140 years, the search for grand and glorious magical items is
called, and adventurers from far and wide convene to participate in the
hunt. This year, though...this year is even more exciting than the
last.<BR>Newhon's already-sparse magic is being leached from the land
itself. Powerful magical items are being misused, and Aarth has called
for the bravest and most daring adventurers to collect these items and
return them to him for safe-keeping. Those who accept this quest will
travel from one end of Newhon to the other, and even beyond, into the
realm of Shadowland. They will be tested by cold, heat, water, and
ice. Their rewards will be great - should they survive to collect.<BR>
Is your party worthy of the Zodac-no-Kara? Take the test of the
riddles, and find out.
