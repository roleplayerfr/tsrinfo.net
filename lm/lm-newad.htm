LANKHMAR - city of thieves, city of adventure. Home to FAFHRD and the
GRAY MOUSER, the greatest adventurers in the world of Newhon.<BR><BR>
Fritz Leiber's classic characters and world spring to life in this
stand-alone role-playing game. Featuring a streamlined set of rules
that were designed expressly for LANKHMAR adventures, yet are fully
compatible with the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, this boxed set
lets two or more players invent their own tales of high adventure in
the winding, shadowy streets of Lankhmar. It includes three books: an
easy-to-read rulebook, a guide to creating exciting adventures in the
world of Newhon, and a pre-made adventure, plus a two-sided, full-color
poster map of the City of LANKHMAR and the world of NEWHON.<BR><BR>Even
if you haven't yet read the Lankhmar stories and novels of Fritz
Leiber, this set will provide countless hours of roguish enjoyment. To
play this game, you need at least one set of polyhedral dice (4-, 6-,
8-, 10-, 12-, and 20-sided dice). They are available where you found
this game, and at hobby shops everywhere.
