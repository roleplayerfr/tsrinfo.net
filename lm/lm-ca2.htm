In the dead of the night, a ghastly fog shrouds the deserted streets.
Doors are locked, windows shuttered, as a deathly silence haunts the
shadows. Almost all of Lankhmar's citizens cower in their homes.
Tonight the streets and alleys of Lankhmar belong to the ancient gods -
this is the Night of Fear.<BR>Whose life will be lost this night - a
lonely wench abandoned in the street? Perhaps a young noblewoman
betrayed by her family?<BR>You can find out, as you venture into the
dark and winding streets of Lankhmar. But beware, eyes are already
watching you.<BR><BR>This 10th to 15th level adventure is designed for
the <a href="lm-coa1.htm">LANKHMAR City of Adventure</a>
setting and the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. It cannot be played
without the <a href="lm-coa1.htm">LANKHMAR City of
Adventure</a> book or the AD&D rules published by TSR Inc.
