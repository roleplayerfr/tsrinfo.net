<i>Wonders of Lankhmar</i> is the latest entry in the AD&D game setting
of Lankhmar, the city of Nehwon made famous as the haunt of Fafhrd and
the Gray Mouser in the tales woven by Fritz Leiber. Within these pages
are dozens of short adventures perfect for an afternoon's or evening's
enjoyment. Your characters may be hired to protect the Overlord from
assassination. They might choose to take positions as caravan guards
on a dangerous passage through a crocodile-infested swamp. Or, perhaps
they'd prefer a quiet night on the town. (They might well prefer it;
the question is, can they find it?)<BR>The City of Thieves is filled
with possibilities: adventure, treachery, deceit, death. Are your
characters up to the challenge? Are they prepared for the wonders of
Lankhmar?
