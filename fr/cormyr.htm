One of the oldest and most interesting kingdoms on the continent of
Faerûn, Cormyr is a land of classic fantasy wherein a strong king rules
his subjects fairly and evenly, nobles struggle against each other for
the little power the king doesn't keep for himself, and adventuring
companies clear forests of ferocious monsters for a small share of the
crown's treasury. And - there's magic. <i>Lots</i> of magic.<BR><BR>
This booklet will allow DM and player alike to wander the King's Forest
and the alleys of Suzail in the mind's eye. It presents indispensable
information for any campaign played in the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting,
including military and magical forces, rules for obtaining adventuring
charters (required by the Crown), and facts about the War Wizards and
Council of Mages.<BR><BR>A full-color map of the area details many
sites not mentioned in the <a href="frbox2.htm">Campaign
Setting</a>, providing the creative DM ideas with which to entertain
players for many nights of adventuring.<BR><BR><i>The <a href="frbox2.htm">
FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting</a> is required for full use of this
product.</i>
