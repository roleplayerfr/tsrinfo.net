"Ye want this ol' moneylender's advice on entering Halaster's Hall yet
again? My advice is this: Don't. There's precious few treasures worth
the death and agony and fear you'll face. Your problems are twofold:
First, ye've walked its halls before, and Halaster pays attention to
those who visit him frequently (and he's the one you don't want to have
watching you!). Second, you're looking for the lair of that lunatic
wizard-murderer from Trades Ward. He's a dangerous lot, that Maddgoth,
and many other met their ends by underestimating that pasty-faced little
scarecrow. If you're looking to lay siege to Maddgoth's Castle, you're
on your own. I've not visited it, and I'm not likely to, either.
Truth be told, no adventurer I've heard of looked for Maddgoth's lair
and returned to tell of it.<BR><BR>"Not that this scares bold heroes
such as ye be, right? Well, the path to fame allows fools and champions
alike, though fools often listen better than heroes. Until our coins
are shared again, good fortune."<BR>-Mirt the Moneylender<BR><BR>This
DUNGEON CRAWL adventure returns once again to the hallowed halls of
Undermountain and into an adventure like those AD&D game archetypes of
years past. This is a stand-alone module and does not require extra
support materials. It can be placed easily into a campaign on any
AD&D world, but best fits a FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign set in Undermountain
or Waterdeep.
