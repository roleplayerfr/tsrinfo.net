As the floating cities of Netheril hover peacefully in the air, the
winds of intrigue boil all around them. The phaerimm continue to plot
the downfall of the Netherese even as Karsus prepares for the casting
of his greatest spell. Undead walk the land, driving orcs and humans
before them. And somewhere below the greatest nation of Faerûn, the
Tarrasque awakens from a long slumber.<BR><BR><i>How the Mighty Are
Fallen</i> is an adventure designed for use with the <a href="nether.htm"><i>
Netheril: Empire of Magic</i></a> boxed campaign setting (which is
required to play this adventure). Within these pages, the final heroes
of Netheril can:<BR><BR><b><i>Gather the components</i></b> that Karsus
requires for casting his "most wondrous" spell, the only 12th-level
spell ever known. He just needs a few body parts from two creatures -
a gold dragon and the Tarrasque.<BR><BR><b><i>Reunite lost lovers</i></b>
after they have been seperated by death. Nopheus's wife was killed in
a magical explosion, and now he's finally saved enough money for her to
be resurrected. Certainly a dead body couldn't pose a threat to a
band of stalwart heroes?!<BR><BR><b><i>Follow the winds of Fate</i></b>
to wherever Tyche delivers them. Numerous side adventure allow players
to take their characters to a variety of different locations. Some
heroes might want to follow the trail of the missing <i>nether scrolls</i>,
while others might want to join the resistance and fight Karsus and
the other archwizards. But only the bravest hearts can take the
first step....
