<i>"Know ye that time is ever so short, even for those who believed
their mythal afforded them all the time on Toril; I pray that ye learn
better from their mistakes than they did themselves - for the dead know
many things, but grasp truth and grow in knowledge they are rarely able
to do."<BR>-Elminster of Shadowdale, Year of the Gauntlet<BR><BR>The
Fall of Myth Drannor</i> is an accessory detailing those horrible
years encompassing the Weeping War, for use with the <a href="corman.htm"><i>
Cormanthyr: Empire of Elves</i></a> book. Herein you will find the
causes of the Fall of that most lyrical of elf cities; highlights of
the twelve campaigns and their most significant battles; copious
adventure hooks for involving player characters in behind-the-scenes
activites; and new (or should we say ancient?) magical items and spells,
most of which have been lost in time.<BR><BR>From the passing of Coronal
Eltargrim to the shattering of the Khov Anilessa's invisible prison to
the stand at Honorsgate, the painful history of the Fall lies within
these pages. Now comes the opportunity for heroes to be made - or
become part of the history in their attempts.
