The infamous <i>Sword of the Dales</i> has always held a certain
fascination in the eyes and hearts of the citizens of the Dalelands.
Thus, it was no surprise when Randal Morn, rebel leader of Daggerdale,
led an expedition into the crypt of a long-dead wizard to recover the
weapon.<BR><BR>Shraevyn the weapons-mage had created the <i>Sword</i>
long ago, and it stood to reason that the blade would be waiting
within his tomb. Perhaps the <i>Sword of the Dales</i> would allow
Randal Morn to rule Daggerdale once again. But Randal Morn never
returned from that fated party. Only tales of terror told by a lone
survivor held any clues as to Randal's fate. A brave band of heroes
accomplished what Randal Morn's group failed to do in part one of this
trilogy, <a href="dales.htm"><i>The Sword of the Dales</i></a>.<BR><BR>
Battling through the tomb's undead inhabitants, those heroes reached
the burial crypt of Shraevyn. There, resting in the center of the
coffin, was the <i>Sword of the Dales</i>, its azure glow fillinf the
chamber. However, there was no sign of Randal Morn.<BR><BR>Only a note
signed by his hand held any clue as to his fate. "Seek me in Spiderhaunt,"
it proclaimed. "The fate of Daggerdale is in your hands."<BR><BR>This
is the second part of a trilogy of modules that began with <a href="dales.htm"><i>
The Sword of the Dales</i></a>. The saga concludes with <a href="morn.htm"><i>
The Return of Randal Morn</i></a>.
