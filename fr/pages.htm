<center>"Any rogue can craft a spell - but it takes a really reckless
fool to write one down."</center><BR>Thus, the wizard Elminster
introduces the latest collection of wizardly lore from the FORGOTTEN
REALMS campaign setting, including:<BR><BR>New spells from mages such
as Daltim, Darsson, and Myrl.<BR><BR>Fell creatures - the Tome
Guardian, the Disenchanter, and the Scalamagdrion.<BR><BR>Details of
more than 40 spellbooks - appearance, history, the magic they contain,
and what is known of the fates of their makers.<BR><BR>And just for
fun - Elminster's very own traveling spellbook!<BR><BR><center>"All
this could have been avoided, of course...If the handful of heedful
folk in the worlds'd listen to me but a few moments more, much trouble
could be averted - and, I suppose, much high adventure. Hmmm...perhaps
'tis the doom of humans to always rush in heedles of the costs - and to
open and read every old, crumbling book they find."<BR>-Elminster</center>
