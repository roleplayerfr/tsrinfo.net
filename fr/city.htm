It is called the City of Splendors: Waterdeep, most populous and
powerful of the cities of the North. It is a city of wealth, adventure,
and danger. More men have died in its taprooms and bars than in all
the seiges of Dragonspear Castle. Success and death lurk in its
shadowed entranceways and dimly-lit streets.<BR>Come explore the
greatest city of the Realms in this incredible new boxes set dealing
with urban fantasy adventures. Waterdeep is detailed in no less than
10 expanded maps, embellished with typical building interiors suitable
for use in any campaign setting. In addition, a full-size poster of
Waterdeep is provided, along with a grand-scale three-dimensional map
of Castle Waterdeep, hub of the city's government.<BR>In addition to
all these maps, a 32-page City System booklet provides encounters and
street scenes, special features and details of Waterdeep, and methods
for creating types of buildings in moments and filling the pockets of
those unfortunate enough to get in a player character's way. Designed
for use with Waterdeep, these new features are suitable for use
anywhere in the Forgotten Realms!<BR><center>It's all here - all you
