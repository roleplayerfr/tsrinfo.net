For years beyond measure, folk of Faerûn have sailed and swum the Inner
Sea from the Lake of Dragons to the Alamber Sea, but few believed there
was more here than a vast expanse of blue water filled with fish, a few
sea monsters, and ever-present pirates. Come, take another look and
discover new worlds above and beneath the sea. Once you enter the Sea
of Fallen Stars, you may never want to go home again.<BR><BR><i>Atop
the Waves:</i> Examine life on the Inner Sea from the major ports and
common superstitions to the goings-on in the Pirate Isles.<BR><BR><i>
Beneath the Seas:</i> Discover the worlds within the Sea! Visit Serôs,
an ancient land. Meet the enigmatic shalarin, a magical sea people from
unknown oceans. Join the mysterious Dukars, magical defenders of the
depths.<BR><BR><i>Myth Nantar, City of Destinies:</i> Wrapped in a
magical mythal, the elven city of Myth Nantar is the perfect place to
make the transition to the world under the waves or to begin a complete
aquatic campaign.<BR><BR><i>Sea of Fallen Stars</i> is the first fully
developed underwater setting for AD&D campaign play. It provides a
focus for the use of the rules supplements <a href="../dd1/ships.htm"><i>
Of Ships and the Sea</i></a> and <a href="../ma/ma-devils.htm"><i>
Sea Devils</i></a>, but neither of these products is needed to use this
book. Contained in these pages is everything you need to adventure in
this exciting world. Bring your game beneath the waves with rules and
magic that make is easy and fun to do, or create sea elf, merman,
triton, locathah, or shalarin PCs using the character-creation rules
herein. Either way, get ready to explore Netherese ruins, sunken ships,
and abyssal trenches in the Sea of Fallen Stars!
