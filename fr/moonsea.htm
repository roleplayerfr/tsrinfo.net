Its waters are the deep purple of the most precious amethyst; its
shores hold some of the most dangerous locations in Faerûn. It is the
Moonsea, home to Zhentil Keep, the Citadel of the Raven, and thousands
of ordinary folk who merely want to make an honest living.<BR><BR>Hark
to the words of Melandryll Belarod, the bard whose writings form the
bulk of this material. He has experienced firsthand the horrors of
ruined Hulburg, the desolation of Sulasspryn, and the stench of
Mulmaster. His travels aboard <i>Devawing</i> have produced this
chronicle of the towns and people of the Moonsea, including both
havens and dangers. Belarod knows of the Citadel of the Rave, a
ten-mile-long series of fortresses and barracks, site of a terrifying
betrayal. He also has evaded the Zhentilar, the crack forces
garrisoned at Zhentil Keep.<BR><BR>In this product are a 64-page <i>
Reference Guide</i> for the Dungeon Master, a 32-page <i>Player's
Guide</i>, and a four-color poster map of the Moonsea region.
