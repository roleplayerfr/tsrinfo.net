In part one of the Randal Morn trilogy, <a href="dales.htm"><i>
Sword of the Dales</i></a>, the legendary leader of Daggerdale, Randal
Morn, was captured by unknown assailants as he sought to regain the
great weapon for which the adventure was named. A stalwart band of
young and enthusiastic heroes was recruited to ride to his aid, yet all
they recovered was the <i>Sword</i> itself and a message: "Seek me in
Spiderhaunt Wood." In the second part of the trilogy, <a href="spider.htm"><i>
The Secret of Spiderhaunt</i></a>, those same adventurers found
Randal and freed him briefly, yet he was almost as quickly torn from
their grasp by an agent of the evil Zhentarim, seeking to end the threat
of Randal Morn's return to power.<BR><BR>In this final episode, the
heroes must follow the kidnapper's trail and rescue Randal Morn before
the Zhentarim finish interrogating him and the axe falls upon his neck.
Armed with the <i>Sword of the Dales</i> and aided by a powerful
magical spirit that lives within the weapon, the heroes much march into
the heart of Zhent-occupied Dagger Falls, free Randal Morn, and save
the city from utter destruction. The job is dangerous - perhaps more
than the heroes can handle - yet those who would live in songs and
legends cannot concern themselves with living to a ripe old age!<BR><BR>
This is the final part of a trilogy of modules that began with <a href="dales.htm"><i>The
Sword of the Dales</i></a> and <a href="spider.htm"><i>The Secret of Spiderhaunt</i></a>.
