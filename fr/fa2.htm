What your players say at the start of <i>Nightmare Keep</i>:<BR>"Oh,
look, an underground labyrinth filled with treasure. No one who's gone
in ever came out alive. Gosh, we've never seen that before, oh no."
(Stifled yawn.)<BR>What they say early on in <i>Nightmare Keep</i>:<BR>
"Hold it! What's going on? Oh, <i>yucccch</i>! We're getting out!
This way, this way! What's that? Oh, no!"<BR>Halfway through <i>Nightmare
Keep</i>:<BR>"Okay. If we stick close and look sharp and don't act
stupid, I think we might get out of this alive."<BR>At the climax of
<i>Nightmare Keep</i>:<BR>"Oh no. Oh no."<BR><BR>A would-be conqueror
is raising hordes of undead insects beneath Wolover's Keep in the
Veilstone Peaks. This evil being was once a lich, a powerful undead
wizard... but that was not enough. Now something strange exists beneath
the Keep, something repellent - and strong beyond measure.<BR><i>Nightmare
Keep</i>: for the AD&D game adventurer with courage, a strong stomach,
and superior firepower. This adventure is set near northwestern
Cormyr in the Forgotten Realms, but it fits easily into any ongoing
high-level campaign.
