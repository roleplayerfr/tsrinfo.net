The place has many names: the Underdark, Deepearth, the Realms Below,
the Night Below, the Lightless Lands. This vast world beneath the
surface is home to fabled races such as beholders, cloakers, drow,
illithids, and ixzan. Menzoberranzan, the dreaded City of Spiders, is
only one of the hidden cities of the Underdark.<BR><BR>This 128-page
book, compiled by the Underdark's most famous son, Drizzt Do'Urden,
lays bare the bizarre societies that lurk in the Realms Below. It
includes an overview of the major races of the Underdark, an Underdark
survival guide, and details and maps of more than a dozen cities.
Discover a drow city constructed entirely of calcified spider silk, a
nigh-immortal dwarven king trapped in stone form, and a storehouse of
knowledge that rivals Candlekeep. Learn the particulars of the alliance
between Manshoon and the beholders of the Anaurian Hive, the ambitions
of the true master of Firedrake Bay, and an explanation of the
enduring strengths of the beholder cults along the Lake of Steam,<BR><BR>
With Drizzt Do'Urden as your guide, a whole new world opens beneath
your feet.<BR><BR>Suitable for all levels of play.
