rare quality and power,<li>Details of the dwarven language, their names
and runes,<li>Details of dwarven clans, priesthoods, and adventuring
brotherhoods,<li>Details of dwarven lands and settlements, including
the fabled riches, ways, and armies of the Great Rift, the Deeps, and
the Lost Kingdoms,<li>New monsters and notes on dwarven halfbreeds and
the special powers wielded by dwarven High Olds Ones,<li>Special metals
and alloys used by the dwarves to hone the blades that slay their
enemies,<li>Dwarven beards...and much, much more!
