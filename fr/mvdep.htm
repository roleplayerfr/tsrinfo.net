<i>Marco Volo: Depature</i> is the first volume of the Marco Volo
trilogy, designed for four to eight player characters of levels 6 to 8.
This free-wheeling adventure begins with an intrigue-laden journey
from Waterdeep to Shadowdale. The party is thrown into the company of
one Marcus Wands (also known as "Marco Volo"), a bothersome but likeable
little rogue. In his guise of Marco, he gains unintentional help from
the party members, leading only to their own arrests. To remedy that
predicament, the characters are strong-armed into carrying an
important letter to Shadowdale, and taking along Marcus as their "guide."<BR><BR>
Of course, things are nowhere near as simple as they seem.<BR><BR>
There's this little matter of the <i>Dragonking's Eye</i>, a powerful
artifact from another plane. Naively, Marcus thought he could steal
the thing and pin the theft on Volothamp Geddarm, the rougish author of
many popular books about cities in the Realms. The notorious
mage-assassin Felibarr Blacklance has been hired to hunt for the thief,
and he is a man grimly determined to earn his fee.<BR><BR>Then there's
the business about this letter that's on its way to Shadowdale. It is
accompanied by a rare enchanted item that wizards and fortune hunters
want to obtain at all costs.<BR><BR>A series of adventures ensues that
takes the adventurers from Waterdeep to the Way Inn, by which time they
will doubtless suspect there is more to Marco Volo than meets the eye.
Amid the brawls and mistaken identities, the wild rides and the
glowering villains, the characters never have a chance to slow down or
catch their collective breath. What results is a light-hearted,
picaresque adventure in the manner of Dumas and Sabatini, and a good
time is had by all!<BR><BR>(Except by the bad guys, of course. They're
never happy with how things are turning out...)
