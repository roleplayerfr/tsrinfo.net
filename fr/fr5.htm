North of Waterdeep, the land is cold, vast, and forbidding. The
Trackless Sea stretches northward for what seems like forever,
interrupted only by the occasional island and, eventually, the ice. On
land, towns and villages flourish right up to the Spine Of The World
Mountains. It takes a special kind of person to live up here, a
determined person used to hardship, a survivor. A person with a great
love for life and a great respect for the forces - both natural and
unnatural - that can end it.<BR>The Savage Frontier is now fully
detailed for your roleplaying campaign. The cultures, personalities,
economics, cities, towns, and wilderness are described for an AD&D
campaign of any size or level. From the barbarian tribes of the far
north to the exciting land where adventures can be found anywhere. And,
of course, it's all part of the best-selling <a href="frbox.htm">
Forgotten Realms Campaign Set</a>, home to many other AD&D modules,
source-books, and even novels!
