<b>The Gods walk the Realms.</b><BR><BR>Cast out from their heavenly
domain, the gods of the Forgotten Realms wander the land as mortals -
extremely powerful mortals, to be certain, but mortals nonetheless.
They seek the lost Tablets of Fate, key to their return. But as the
good and evil gods of the Realms bring their fight down to earth, the
people and lands are caught in between. Nature itself revolts: Strange
creatures stalk the countryside, and even magic become unpredictable.<BR><BR>
When a band of adventurers are hired by a young apprentice to rescue
her sorceress-mentor, little do they realize the size of the stakes
they will soon be playing for. Caught up in a power struggle that will
determine the fate of the Realms themselves, the first step is to find
the only mortal who may know what's going on - the legendary sage
Elminster. And that means going to Shadowdale.<BR><BR><i>Shadowdale</i>
is the first of a three-part series of modules for the ADVANCED
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS 2nd Edition roleplaying game. Set in the popular
FORGOTTEN REALMS game world, this module features the same settings and
many of the same characters of the first novel of the Avatar Trilogy,
<i>Shadowdale</i>, by Richard Awlinson. This AD&D 2nd Edition adventure
is for four to six characters of levels 5-8.
