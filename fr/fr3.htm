In the southwest corner of Faerun, a thousand miles south of Waterdeep
on the great Trade Way road, lie the three lands known collectively as
the Empires of the Sands. They are harsh lands that have produced
tough people - proud, fierce, and hard-working.<BR>The Empires of the
Sands are now fully detailed for your role-playing campaign. The
cultures, personalities, economics, cities, towns, and wilderness are
described for an AD&D campaign of any size or level. Amn, land of
merchants, where everything has a price; Tethyr, where petty tyrants
vie for a vacant throne and evil grows; and Calimshan, a dry land
where great magic is commonplace - all are waiting for you. This
sourcebook includes <i>two</i> full-color maps showing the Empires of
the Sands that link up with the maps provided in the original <a href="frbox.htm">
Forgotten Realms boxed set</a>, and all the information you need to
establish an exciting campaign.
