<center>The penninsula of Wa is no place to visit. The land is poor,
the people wary and suspicious. Yet this quiet backwater has been the
site of strange disturbances - mysterious disappearances and omens of
dire events to come. Why do the animals of Wa disappear, only to
return a short while later? Who are the Blue Kumi bandits, and why are
they so active? Why do the black geese fly into the Jusofu Mountains?
And what fell creature lurks along the southern coast of Wa?<BR>Or does
the stench of corruption emanate from the Celestial Bureacracy itself?
Could the danger, unchecked, grow great enough to doom all living
creatures in Kara-Tur? Which clues will lead to the truth, and which
are merely traps for the unwary...<BR><i>Test of the Samurai</i> will
take the players across the Wa peninsula and to the unknown land of
Qui. They will encounter such legendary beasts as the feng huang
(phoenix) and the chi'-lin (unicorn) as they attempt to discover the
secrets of Wa.<BR><BR><i>Test of the Samurai</i> is a scenario for the
<i>Oriental Adventures</i> supplement to the AD&D game. It is set in
<i>Kara-Tur</i>, the oriental world in the Forgotten Realms. Although
<i>Test of the Samurai</i> follows the events of module <a href="oa6.htm">
OA6, <i>Ronin Challenge</i></a>, it is an independent adventure for
five to eight characters of levels 6-9.
