Well met, traveler!<BR><BR>Welcome to the latest in the popular series
of guidebooks penned by Volothamp Geddarm. You hold in your hands an
overview of the most important inns, taverns, shops, and tourist
attractions in the western Heartlands, the coast of which is known as
the Sword Coast. These lands begin south of fabled Waterdeep and the
Savage Frontier, continue up to the northern borders of Amn, and reach
east as far as the desert's edge and Tunland. This perilous region
sees some of the heaviest caravan traffic in all the Realms. Every
merchant who enters the lands of the Sword Coast should have a copy of
this guide ready to hand. As usual, all features and establishments
covered are ranked with Volo's handy coin, dagger, pipe, and tankard
rating system.<BR><BR>Discover:<BR><BR>Where pirates go to drink the
night away and plot which ships and ports they'll next strike at,<BR>
The best craftsfolk of the Sword Coast,<BR>Where the best caravan
masters can be found - and where they dare not go,<BR>Local legends and
rumors of rich treasures not yet found and plundered,<BR>Haunted ruins
and other places that must be seen - from a safe distance,<BR>Where
mighty wizards and sword-swinging adventurers dwell,<BR>Dragon lairs -
and the dwelling places of worse monsters!<BR><BR><center><i>Suitable
for all levels of play.</i></center><BR>Special Note: This edition of <i>
Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast</i>, intended for travelers from beyond
the borders of Faerûn, contains notes and commentary by the famous
