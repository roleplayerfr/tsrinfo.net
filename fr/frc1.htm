A great evil force descended on the town of Phlan years ago. The
townspeople were all either killed or driven away, and Phlan became
(literally) a ghost town. Fifty years later, the survivors are ready
to reclaim their town. But they need a band of strong and brave
adventurers to lead the fight - they need <i>you.<BR><BR>Ruins of
Adventure</i> is a set of connected short adventures written by James
Ward, David "Zeb" Cook, Steve Winter, and Mike Breault - four names
familiar to all AD&D game fans. It uses the same setting, locations,
and characters as the computer game <i>Pool of Radiance</i> by
Strategic Simulations, Inc. In fact, many of the scenarios here in
<i>Ruins of Adventure</i> will provide important clues to the successful
completion of <i>Pool of Radiance</i>.
