The Forgotten Realms fantasy world has been the site of many great
adventures and home to countless valiant heroes and infamous villains.
Many a tale of derring-do has been recounted in novels like the Moonshae
trilogy by Douglas Niles, <i>The Crystal Shard</i> by R.A.Salvatore, <i>
Azure Bonds</i> by Kate Novak and Jeff Grubb, and <i>Spellfire</i> by
Ed Greenwood (creator of the Forgotten Realms fantasy world).<BR>Until
now, the characters from these Forgotten Realms novels habe been
unavailable to AD&D game players. But no longer.<BR><i>Hall of Heroes</i>
provides complete histories and AD&D game statistics for such beloved
characters as Elminster, the greatest sage and magic user of the Realms,
Tristan Kendrick and Robyn of the Moonshae isles, Wulfgar the Barbarian,
Drizzt the dark elf, and Bruenor the dwarf, all from the northern
reaches, plus Alias and Dragonbait, Shandril and Narm Tamaraith, and
many more.<BR>But the Hall of Heroes is more than a listing of game
statistics: It's also a sourcebook describing (among other things)
artificial and magical lifeforms of the Realms, as well as the lives
of the world's elves, dwarves, lizardmen, and exotic creatures.<BR>
Whatever your interest in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, you'll
find much to entertain and intrigue you in this volume.
