It begins as a simple martial arts tournament. Sure, your skills are
tested and you might even win a trophy - or learn a lesson or two.
But it's still just a tournament....<BR><BR>Until someone starts
playing for keeps.<BR><BR>When a traitor to the empire is revealed, His
Excellency calls loyal and heroic citizens to follow the trail of
deception. The scale of the treachery is grand - it seems that an
entire army has turned its back on its rightful liege!<BR><BR>The trail
leads through trackless (or seemingly trackless) mountains, into
peaceful (or seemingly peaceful) valleys. The emperor has promised
great rewards to heroes who can solve his mystery, but as the journey
progresses the heroes find their own reasons for continuing.<BR><BR>
As a sinister suspicion grow in the minds, the adventure reaches its
climax in the ruins of an ancient civilization. Finally, our heroes
are faced with an ultimate choice - between success and failure, loyalty
and betrayal, even good and evil.<BR><BR>On their choice rests the
future of nations.
