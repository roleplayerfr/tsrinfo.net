The jingle of gold and the chance to earn glory in the battlefield
motivate many people to answer the call to arms. These men and women
are mercenaries, willing to fight someone else's battle for the chance
to earn a few coins or lasting fame. <i>Gold & Glory</i> describes the
mercenary companies of the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting. The
famous and the infamous are detailed within: the Flaming Fist, possibly
the most powerful private army on Toril; The Mindulgulph Mercenary
Company, certainly the most bizarre; the honorable Bushido, the sly
Masquerade, the snobbish Order of the Blue Boar, the hard-fighting
She-Wolves, and many more. Many of the companies are brought to life
in the 16 full-page full color portraits in this sourcebook. Gaming
information, including statistics for Battlesystem Game scenarios, is
offered as well. Player characters can adventure with these mercenary
corps, earning gold and glory for themselves.
