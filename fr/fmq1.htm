Somewhere in the True World, to the north of the lands you know, lies
the City of Gold: Michaca. It is a city of legend, of fable, and of
wonder. The journey is hard, and the perils are many; you know,
however, that the rewards will far outshine any treasure you have ever
seen.<BR><BR>This supplement for the <a href="maz.htm">
Maztica Campaign Setting</a> is a new type of product: a combination
adventure and accessory. In this booklet you will find information on
a new character race, the Azuposi; on new character classes for rogues,
including the clown (or <i>koyemshis</i>); on new priest classes,
including the "bent priest"; and a new magic unique to Maztica, fetishism.<BR><BR>
The adventure itself leads your party from the known areas of the True
World into the northlands, through the lands of the desert dwarves, the
Poscadar elves, the Dog People, and others. Your characters will deal
with desert hardships they have never endured before. They will also
confront spirits they've never heard of: the spirits that have caused
the downfall of Michaca, the City of Gold.<BR><BR>And do not forget the
words of a poet of another place, and another time: "Nor all that tempts
your wand'ring eyes / And heedless hearts, is lawful prize; / Nor all,
that glisters, gold."
