Cryptic rumors spread across the far North, sparking new interest in a
shadow-haunted ruin. Although it was once a seat of ancient dwarven
power, centuries of unspeakable evil have transformed this former gem
mine into the demon-infested, trap-filled Dungeon of Death. Its name
is well deserved - unwary visitors fall victim either to the ravenous
fiends that reside within the dungeon or to the insidious Shadow Curse
that pervades the place. Inside lies a grueling challenge of skill and
courage that only the bravest and most experienced heroes will survive.<BR><BR>
This stand-alone adventure is set within one of the most infamous
dungeons of the Realms. It easily fits within an existing FORGOTTEN
REALMS campaign, and it can also be incorporated into any other AD&D
campaign world with minor modifications.<BR><BR><center>The Dungeon of
