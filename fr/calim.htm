<center><b>The City of Glory Revealed at Last!</b></center><BR><i>
"Calimport? I'd sooner dive headfirst into Undermountain than risk my
ship going to that gods-forsaken city!"<BR><BR>"Ah - the fabled City of
Glory. Its wonders remain unmatched by any other city across Faerûn,
e'en Waterdeep, for Calimport foes not impede anyone's business due to
some overbearing morality."<BR><BR>"Walking through Calimport, either
among the alleys or atop the sabban walls with the nobility, immerses
you in danger and corruption, as if you swam through eels and asps
rather than walked its dusty, ill-kept roads."</i><BR><BR>What can one
truly know about a place until he or she has experienced it firsthand?
Calimport is a place of many truths, each more disturbing than the
last. It is also the most influential trade city in souther Faerûn,
wheter its detractors admit it or not. Building on materials from <a href="sea.htm"><i>
Empires of the Shining Sea</i></a>, this supplement expands
tremendously on what we know about the city that has been the seat of
Calishite power since the arrival of the djinni lord Calim eight
millennia ago. What can be found inside?<BR><BR>The history of
Calimport on a broad scale, showing the ebb and flow of power surrounding
the city across time.<BR><BR>A sweeping look at the city itself,
including all of its landmarks, wards, and sabbans (districts),
providing for the first time the key to finding ways through a city of
more than two million people.<BR><BR>A close-up view of the Eraré
Sabban and its Taorahl Drudach, a waterfront district and neighborhood
designed to be a central base in your own Calimport campaigns.<BR><BR>
Numerous magical items and artifacts, many of which hide among
Calimport's shadows, from the <i>Battlecloak of Vycaena</i> and the <i>
Codex Thealnakkar</i> to the <i>Staff of Shoon</i> and the <i>Tome of
Secrets</i>.<BR><BR>Everything you need to know about the
peril-riddled alleys, palaces, and underworld of the most dangerous
city on Faerûn is contained within this 96-page book. Walk the dark
paths among the sabbans or fly among the gilded minarets, but know that
a thousand eyes and a thousand intrigues swirl about you at any moment!
Come explore one of the oldest cities of Faerûn. The trip may change
your life....
