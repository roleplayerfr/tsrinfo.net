<i>Had I not seen the chaos that ensued, I would never have believed
the tale Shadowdale's sage wove for me that day.... Who would have
believed that anything had the power to rip Halaster Blackcloak bodily
from his Undermountain? Who again could predict the maelstrom of
dangers that a dungeon gone mad would unleash upon an unsuspecting
Realms? It is thanks to the brave and noble souls who dared reach into
the villains' clutches to save the life of Halaster the Mad Mage that
we all rise to greet another sun.</i><BR>-Gamalon Idogyr, starfaring
mage formerly of Llorbauth<BR><BR>This DUNGEON CRAWL adventure returns
once more to the hallowed halls of Undermountain, but it's a different
day. At dawn of Highharvestide 1369, every practitioner of magic on
the Sword Coast knew there was a problem. By midmorning, the Lords of
Waterdeep confirmed the ill omens: Some brave souls worthy of the title
"Hero" must enter Undermountain on a mission to save Halaster
Blackcloak! Could these heroes be your group of player characters?<BR><BR>
This is a stand-alone module and does not require extra support
materials. It can be placed into a campaign on any AD&D world, but
best fits and impacts a FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign set in Undermountain
or Waterdeep.
