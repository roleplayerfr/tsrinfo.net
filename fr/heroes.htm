They are the stuff legends are made of. In fact, they <i>are</i> the
legends.<BR><BR>The major characters who have fought - and in some
cases died - for the sake of goodness and justice in all parts of the
FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign world are chronicled for posterity in <i>
Heroes' Lorebook</i>, a 160-page compendium of the heroes whose exploits
have filled dozens of novels over the past decade.<BR><BR>Inside you'll
find updated game statistics and descriptions for Elminster, Drizzt
Do'Urden, Alias, and many other characters who appeared in the <a href="fr7.htm"><i>
Hall of Heroes</i></a> collection published in 1989, as well as a host
of brand-new biographies for heroes such as Brianna and Tavis Burdun,
Alicia Kendrick, Cadderly, and Danica, who have never been featured in
a game product until now.<BR><BR>No collection of FORGOTTEN REALMS
gaming literature is complete without this "Who's Who" of the people -
and creatures - who have prevented the forces of evil from having
their way.
