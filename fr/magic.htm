For aeons, folk have struggled to master the world of Toril through
the use of magic. The human race has stolen what magical knowledge it
can from the elves and other races, gained more through worship, and
created the rest by building on the work of those who have gone before.
For centuries, human wizards have experimented with new spells and
variations on existing magic, striving to grow ever more powerful.
They have succeeded to an astonishing degree, but through the death of
secretive mages and the destruction of realms and entire peoples, much
of the lore they built has been lost, hidden, or distorted. To pierce
this heavy cloak of missing knowledge, cryptic sorcerous codes, and
misinformation requires a writer of rare daring, persistence, and
magical skill. Such a man is Volothamp Geddarm, famous traveler of the
Realms - and this is his most important, long-suppressed work, the book
that archwizards could not keep from your hands!<BR><BR>Read this
128-page tome, and learn:<BR>How mages gain special powers for
themselves - including the awesome ability known as spellfire.<BR>How
items may be enchanted to fire forth magic once, twice, or whenever
called upon.<BR>The best materials from which to construct magical
items.<BR>Powerful spells that have hitherto been the secrets of the
most puissant archmages.<BR>Details of many of the fell, awesome
artifacts of the Realms know to exist.<BR>Lore about teleportation,
magical wards, guardian spells, and sites of power.<BR>Much, much more
that most wizards would have liked to remain hidden from the eyes of
their rivals - and common folk not skilled in magic - forever!<BR><BR><center><i>
Suitable for all levels of play.</i></center><BR>SPECIAL NOTE: This
edition of <i>Volo's Guide to All Things Magical</i>, intended for
travelers from beyond the borders of Faerûn, has been heavily rewritten
and contains game notes and commentary by the famous sage and archmage
Elminster of Shadowdale.
