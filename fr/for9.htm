<center><i>Mages kill each other to become the Magister.</i></center><BR>
The Magister of Mystara is one of the most mysterious - and misunderstood -
beings in the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting. Some say the Magister is
simply the most powerful mortal mage in all of Toril. Perhaps, but
there is something more, something unique, about being so touched by the
Mother of All Magic.<BR><BR>The mages of Faerûn roll up their sleeves
and craft spells and items that they hope will empower them to win the
office of the Magister. A few will succeed. More will wish they'd
never taken up magic in the first place.<BR><BR>Here at last, one can
learn all the secrets, abilities, and sacred duties of the Magister.
Plus, discover the fate of Lady Nouméa and the identity of her
successor as Magister. Also, read guidelines on how a PC mage might
become the Magister.<BR><BR>This book holds the history of the office,
new powers, spells, magic items, a roster of select Magisters from the
past, and guidelines on how to incorporate the Magister into your
campaign.<BR><BR><center><i>One Magister became a god; others have
hoped to.</i></center>
