For many years, Evermeet has remained a mystery, known only as the
elves' place of refuge. So far, details about the island itself, its
geography, rulers, and society have been sketchy. It is known that
Evermeet is protected by illusory magic, that ships lose their way or
vanish mysteriously if they approach the isle, and that the elven navy
is the finest in the realms. Past publications have also revealed that
Evermeet is ruled by Queen Amlaruil, and that her husband Zaor was
murdered decades ago. Beyond this, little is known.<BR>The <i>Elves of
Evermeet</i> attempts to investigate and explain the inner workings of
the elven island, and develop the realm as a setting for FORGOTTEN
REALMS adventures. Until now, Evermeet has been reserved exclusively
for the elves and officially closed to humans, dwarves, and other
races. But this product will help you work Evermeet into your campaign
and allow other PC races to visit, or at least interact, with the
mysterious island.<BR>Included are:<BR>new elven magic (for High Mages),<BR>
elven NPCs,<BR>tips on playing Evermeet elves,<BR>gods and goddesses of
the island, and<BR>adventure ideas for your own campaign!<BR><BR>Bring
the wonder that is Evermeet into your game, with this sourcebook. It's
a mystery no more!
