<center>A Curse Is On The Land</center><BR>Daggerford is fairly quiet
for a frontier town. Sure, lizard men raid the local baron's holding
now and then, orcs sneak out of the Misty Forest to raid caravans on
the Trade Way, and lady Bronwyn has a few suitors who are a touch too
passionate, but there's nothing going on that a member of the renowned
Daggerford militia can't handle.<BR>Except that the Shining River has
turned green, the cattle are dying. Except that the Elf King of
Laughing Hollow, a place where no human dares to go without fearing for
his life, is asking the militia for help. Except that strange
substances are oozing from the fissures caused by a recent earthquake.
Except that the earthquake also has opened an entrance in the cliffs
around Laughing Hollow that might lead to the fabled dwarf mines of
Illefarn.<BR>Suddenly, being a militiaman isn't quite as easy as it
used to be...<BR><BR><i>Under Illefarn</i> is the first module
produced for use with the <a href="frbox.htm">FORGOTTEN
