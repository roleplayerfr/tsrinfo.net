Deep within the heart of the jungles of Far Payit is a city lost to
time and the modern people of Maztica. Long ago abandoned by its
people, it holds a deadly secret deep beneath its ruined surface, a
secret held safe by a tribe of inhuman guardians.<BR>A secret that has
remained inviolate until now.<BR>A cleric of the church of Helm has
disappeared. A piece of a map to the lost city of Ixtzul has been
found. Great armies of ants perform deadly assassinations. And in the
jungle, a new leader has appeared, promising power to those who follow
her into the forbidden vale.<BR>Now the heroes must follow as well, to
uncloak the mystery and prevent the unleashing of a deadly force on the
surface world of Maztica, a force that threatens both people of Payit
and the newcomers' civilization in Helmsport. Should the heroes fail
to defeat the endless armies of their foe, all in Maztica will perish!
