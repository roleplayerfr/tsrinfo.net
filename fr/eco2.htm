An excerpt from <i>A Treatise on the Life of the High Moor</i> by the
druid Bara:<BR><BR><i>The environment includes such things as terrain,
flora, fauna, weather, and natural and arcane forces. All these
elements - each aspect of the environment and each organism - form a
tapestry known as the ecology. And like a tapestry of cloth, this one
can suffer severe damage if a single thread is removed, no matter how
ugly the thread.</i><BR><BR>This appendix includes two booklets penned
by friends of Elminster of Shadowdale. Collected here are:<BR><BR>a
32-page booklet containing the words of the inimitable Bara, feisty
druid of the High Moor, describing the ecology of that region;<BR><BR>
a 32-page booklet by the Lark of Suzail that gives her descriptions of
the slithering inhabitants of the Serpent Hills; and<BR><BR>a brief
booklet of tables to aid the Dungeon Master in determining random
encounters for adventurers whose travels take them through these areas.<BR><BR>
Those planning to explore these regions would be well advised to read
the works herein to prepare themselves for the reptilian dangers of
the Serpent Hills and the hazards of the High Moor - from its beasts
to its protective druid itself!
