<center>The followers of the many gods of Kara-Tur have always fought,
to prove the superiority of their martial discipline and the greater
wisdom of their deities. The strict hierarchy of the gods is now
threatened by the sudden prominence of the followers of the Dragon Claw,
a new and deadly school of martial arts that threatens to destroy all
other schools. The players, recruited by a mysterious old monk with a
bizarre fighting style, must find out what's behind the emergence of
the Dragon Claw and put a stop to it.<BR><i>Mad Money vs. The Dragon
Claw</i> will take players across the entire country of T'u Lung, from
