<i>As Kiruna reached the mouth of the cavern, she realized the heat was
emanating from two towering braziers, one on either side of the
entrance. Deep gouges - now she could see they were runes, of ancient
origin - ringed their bases and rims, their lines and curves carved by
instruments far larger than any she could wield.<BR>Her eyes adjusted
slowly to the darkness within the stone giants' home. On the walls she
could make out stunning friezes and portraits, all carved in bas-relief
with artistry like none she had seen back home in Shadowdale. Kiruna
stood for a moment, gazing on these immense figures and faces, her
reverie broken only by the realization that she was shivering; no, not
shivering, but being shaken. The floor was quivering, and, echoing in
the depths of the darkness, footsteps approached....</i><BR><BR>Enter
the world of Faerûn's giants as first revealed in Troy Denning's
"Twilight Giants" trilogy of novels. <i>Giantcraft</i> presents game
material based on those characters and events, including statistics
for Princess Brianna, Tavis Burdun, and others; a section on
player-character giants and giant-kin; a chapter on giant religion; a
new magic-using class, the runecaster; details on giant rune magic;
and detailed lairs for the main giant types found in the Ice Spires and
their environs. Read about <i>levendhule</i>, the forbidden "living
cave"; uncover the secrets of the Ordning; learn the history of the
sons and daughters of Annam. Dungeon Masters and players alike are
certain to find invaluable information in this latest Realms sourcebook.
