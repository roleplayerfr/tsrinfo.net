Welcome to the picturesque village of Eveningstar, nestled at the foot
of the Stonelands where the River Starwater winds down a gorge and
snakes into the King's Forest.<BR>Here, the Knights of Myth Drannor
began their famous adventures. Here, the Ladies of the Brazen Blade,
The Company of the Singing Sword, The Steel Shield Band, and many others
came, clutching royal charters from King Azoun with the ink scarcely
dry on the parchment. Some fell, some went on to greatness - but they
all came here first: here, to the Haunted Halls.<BR>Despite numerous
infiltrations, the Halls have not yet yielded all their secrets or
treasures. Many dangers lurk as deadly as ever in dark chambers herein,
awaiting new companies of eager-eyed adventurers.<BR>Is it your turn to
dare The Haunted Halls? Many come, but few survive to again see
Eveningstar's beauty.<BR>Welcome, then. Enter in, and find in these
pages:<BR>A challenging introductory-level dungeon.<BR>A detailed
countryside setting, including important local personages, local color,
and guidelines for play.<BR>Suggested campaign plots and adventures.<BR>
New spells.<BR>New magical items.<BR>New monsters.<BR>A splendid
campaign can begin here. Adventurers in an ongoing campaign can stop
by for a memorable visit. Those looking for an underground stronghold
may even find a home in the Haunted Halls of Eveningstar.
