The Purple Dragon is caged!<BR><BR>But Ra-Khati isn't out of danger.
The evil Raja Ambuchar Devayam is holding the Dalai Lama to his promise.
If the player-characters don't deliver Princess Bhrokiti and the Black
Courser to him - and even if they do - the Raja's foul army will once
again march on the Hidden Kingdom. What is it that Devayam really wants
with Ra-Khati?<BR><BR>Only your player-characters can discover the
awful truth. When they do, their journey will take them to the farthest
reaches of Shou Lung. Providing they can escape the diabolic assassin
sent to stop them, they will find the lost city of Kuo Meilan. There,
they must penetrate to the lost city's wicked heart and find the Stone
Scepter of Shih. Only armed with this artifact, and the secret
connecting it to Ambuchar Davayam, can they hope to save Ra-Khati - or
themselves.<BR><BR><i>The Black Courser</i> is the second adventure in
