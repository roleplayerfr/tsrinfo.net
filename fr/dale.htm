Betwee Cormyr and the Moonsea lie the beautiful forests and fields of
the Dalelands, home to some of the most powerful characters and
exciting adventures in the Heartlands. Proud and free, these scattered
realms stand against the dark evil of Zhentil Keep and the savage
raiders of the mountains and forests. Ancient magic lies buried in
dangerous ruins within the vast Elven Woods, waiting for the hand bold
enough to seize it.<BR>The Dalelands are a place where adventurers are
welcomed, and heroes rewarded with gold, honor, and power. Enemies,
old and new, move against the Dales constantly, and the call goes out
for brave and true heroes to defend the land!<BR>The Dalelands are the
oldest campaign setting of the Forgotten Realms, finally described in
detail. New and exciting information about each of these independent
lands is contained in this accessory. Of course, the dark and
sinister enemies who plot against the Dales are described as well!
Prepare to meet the challenges of the Dalelands.!
