<center>An Excerpt from<BR><i>An Investigation into the Natural
Systems of Organisms and Their Surroundings,</i><BR>by Elminster of
Shadowdale</center><BR><i>The world is vast and varied, comprising
towering mountains, dense jungles, and sprawling seas. There are
regions so cold that their snow never melts, others so hot that their
rain turns to steam as it touches the ground.<BR>It is this variety
of environments that accounts for the variety of life. In my travels
I have noted 73 distinct types of pine trees.... I estimate the number
of fishes at well over five thousand. The number of insect species
likely exceeds the number of grains of sand on the shores of Dragon
Reach.<BR>Every environment, no matter how hostile to humankind, is
compatible with some form of life. The diversity and adaptability of
organisms are staggering....</i><BR><BR>Within this box are nine
booklets. Eight of them, each written by an expert in the area,
describe various ecological niches on the continent of Faerûn. Begin
by reading the <i>Explorer's Manual</i>, which:<BR><BR>introduces the
reader to the organization of the eight area-specific booklets.<BR><BR>
contains the whole of the above excerpt from Elminster's
work-in-progress about Realmsian biodiversity, and<BR><BR>provides
color-coded encounter tables for the eight other booklets along with
instructions for their use.<BR><BR>Would-be travelers are advised to
read well the information presented by the Sage of Shadowdale and his
eight compatriots, and to memorized the Rules of the Rabbit. There
are only three: <i>A rabbit isn't always a rabbit. A rabbit doesn't
want to be rich. A rabbit doesn't always stay put.</i> An explantion?
You'll find it in the <i>Explorer's Manual</i>. Read on, thou
hearty adventurer.
