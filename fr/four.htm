The kingdom of Cormyr is a land of law and order, a country populated
by citizens who live good lives and treat their neighbors well. If you
think these characteristics make Cormyr an unexciting and uninviting
place...think again.<BR><BR>Despite the ever-present Purple Dragon
soldiers and War Wizards who are charged with keeping the kingdom safe
from treachery and greed, Cormyr is a place where evil lurks in
countless nooks and crannies, where opportunites for heroic adventurers
to do good for themselves and for all of Cormyr are as abundant as the
dents on a dwarf's helmet.<BR><BR><i>Four from Cormyr</i> is a quartet
of adventures that can be played individually or as a series. By the
time they have experienced all that lies within this 128-page book,
ranging from a grand soiree at the home of a noble to a chilling
expedition into the Vast Swamp, player characters will know more about
this challenging land than they ever thought they would need to know -
and even if they succeed in countering all the threats they will face,
they'll find that the conclusion to each adventure opens a new vista of
possibilities for continuing danger and intrigue.<BR><BR>Suitable for
six to eight characters of levels 9-12
