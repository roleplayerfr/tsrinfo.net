The Wyrmskull Throne - the ruling seat of the great dwarven nation of
Shanatar - has been lost for five millennia. Now, rumors have surfaced
that it has been found, and there are sinister parties that will stop
at nothing to claim it. But the path to finding the throne is long and
twisted, leading from a small vilalge in the remotest regions of
Tethyr to the bottom of the ocean! Those who follow it had best be
prepared for the strange and wondrous - as well as enemies on every
side - for it is no journey for the faint of heart.<BR><BR><i>The
Wyrmskull Throne</i> is a companion adventure for the FORGOTTEN REALMS
accessory <a href="fallen.htm"><i>Sea of Fallen Stars</i></a>.
It can be played as a stand-alone adventure or with the material
presented in that volume.
