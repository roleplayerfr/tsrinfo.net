The Undead. Denied the eternal rest of Death, cursed to wander the many
planes and worlds forever, their very existence a mockery of the life
they constantly crave yet cannot have. Created by the foulest magics,
they have only one thought, one burning goal: revenge against the
living. Or do they?<BR><i>Lords of Darkness</i> is an anthology of
short adventures set in various locations in the Forgotten Realms, though
you don't need the <a href="frbox.htm">FORGOTTEN REALMS
campaign supplement</a> to use them. Some of gaming's best designers
have contributed adventures to this collection, which feature undead of
all types and descriptions in all sorts of situations - from skeletons
to vampires and worse, from graveyards to haunted houses, and even a
few places you may never have expected to find the undead.<BR><BR>These
adventures can be used one at a time, inserted into an existing campaign
as a change of pace, or they can be a basis for an entirely new campaign.
Either way, <i>Lords of Darkness</i> will be sure to give AD&D game
players plenty of chills and excitement.
