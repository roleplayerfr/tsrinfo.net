Is your FORGOTTEN REALMS character an elf? A dwarf? Maybe a gnome?
Perhaps, yet that doesn't really say much, does it? One might just as
easily say there's no difference between a Calishite and a Thayan
because they're both humans! No one is <i>just</i> a demihuman in the
Realms - there are acrobats, barbarians, giant killers, manhunters,
pestkillers, prospectors, and even tunnelrats, but they're all
demihumans and they all walk the face of Faerûn.<BR>Within these pages
are dozens of kits designed to help players in a FORGOTTEN REALMS
campaign enrich their characters and make them truly native to the
Realms. Special benefits and disadvantages for each kit enhance roots
and racial heritages. This companion to <a href="wr.htm"><i>
Wizards and Rogues of the Realms</i></a> and <a href="wp.htm"><i>
Warriors and Priests of the Realms</i></a> completes the series of
kit-based sourcebooks for the FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign.
