For over a decade, mystery has surrounded the fate of the lost goddess
of trade and wealth, Waukeen. The Golden Lady disappeared during the
Time of Trouble and has not been heard from since. Now, in Marpenoth
in the Year of the Tankard (1370 DR), a young prophet suffers from
disturbing, divine visions that reveal a beautiful, golden-tressed
woman imprisoned on a far plane of existence by some great evil.<BR><BR>
The leader of Waukeen's church believes that these visions mean Waukeen
is alive but trapped in the deadly and dangerous Abyss. A party of
adventurers is dedicated to peeling back the mystery of the Golden
Lady's fate. Their route takes them to the plane-spanning Infinite
Staircase and beyond, to the Abyss, the home of the demonic tanar'ri.
The heroes must brave the dangers of the Abyss and rescue the lost
goddess from the clutches of one of the most brilliant and dangerous of
all Abyssal lords.<BR><BR>This stand-alone adventure was developed in
concert with the PLANESCAPE adventure anthology <a href="../ps/ps-stair.htm"><i>
Tales from the Infinite Staircase</i></a>. They can be played seperately.
However, guidelines within both allow a Dungeon Master to use either
product as a subplot for the other, creating new opportunities for
player characters and extending the opportunity for adventure.
