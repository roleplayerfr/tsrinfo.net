Day breaks, and the crowing of a distant rooster wakes you from an
all-too-short sleep. Another day of adventure, you think as you arise -
but then you stop short. You, and all your companions, have an
elaborate blue tatoo covering most of your sword arm!<BR>And there's
more to these marks than a drunken prank. As you try to find out
the source and the meaning of your new adornment, you are drawn further
and further into danger and mystery. Will you become a pawn in somebody
else's power game, or will you fight for your freedom and individuality?<BR>
Curse of the Azure Bonds is an adventure set in the <a href="frbox2.htm">FORGOTTEN
REALMS game world</a> for the AD&D 2nd Edition game. It is based on the
best-selling novel, Azure Bonds, by Jeff Grubb and Kate Novak. And
watch for the Azure Bonds computer game, coming soon from Strategic
Simulations, Inc.!
