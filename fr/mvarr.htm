<i>Marco Volo - Arrival</i> is the third and last volume of the <i>
Marco Volo</i> trilogy, designed for four to eight player characters of
6th-8th level. When the characters first set off on an intrigue-laden
journey to Shadowdale, they did not suspect how much trouble they
would get into. Joined by Marcus Wands (also known as "Marco Volo"),
they found him just a bothersome but likeable little rogue. No one
suspected he was on the run from the crazy wizard Sabbar. The
troublesome Marcus had previously stolen from him a rare artifact called
the <i>Dragonking's Eye</i>, and hid it in the Spiderhaunt Woods.<BR><BR>
Now the party approaches the Spiderhaunts, and Marcus insists on
diverting the group to retrieve the <i>Eye</i>. But strange things
have been happening there. There are rumors: of an oddly constructed
keep of bone (or is it crystal?); of a warlord out for conquest (or is
it a lich?); of goblin tribes strangely clad, and extra-planar beings
banding with the giant spiders of the aptly named Spiderhaunt Woods.
Something evil has denned at the heart of the forest. It has a mind of
its own....and it has plans for Faerûn.<BR><BR>The last volume of the
<i>Marco Volo</i> trilogy gives a DM the tools to run this free-wheeling,
fast-paced adventure, and the secrets of the powers at work behind the
scenes. The player characters must face - and deal with - the mad
wizard Sabbar, the annoyed Volothamp Geddarm (who wants to have "a
little chat" with Marcus!), and ultimately the <i>Dragonking's Eye</i>
itself. Even the gods themselves step in to have their say. In a
dramatic denouement, this epic adventure draws to a close, but the
memory of what transpired will live on!
