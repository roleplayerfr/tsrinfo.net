What makes a god a god? How are divine powers created, and how do they
die? How powerful is a greater diety compared to a lesser deity? These
questions and many more are answered for the FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign
setting within <i>Faiths & Avatars</i>.<BR><BR>Detailed in this 192-page
core supplement are the most prominent religions and deities of the
Realms. Each divine power is covered in depth by an entry that includes
information about the deity's appearance, personality, worshipers,
portfolio, aliases, domain name, superior, allies, foes, symbol,
woshipers' alignments, avatar, manifestations, church, and specialty
priests. The information on each relgion includes its core dogma,
day-to-day activites of priests, holy days and important ceremonies,
major centers of worship, affiliated orders, and the priestly
vestaments and adventuring garb of members of the clergy. Finally, each
entry contains spells specific to each of the relgions - some new, some
long unavailable or hard to find, and some updated to conform with the
current AD&D game rules.<BR><BR><i>Faiths & Avatars</i> includes:<BR><BR>
All the greaters, intermediate, and lesser deities of the Faerûnian
pantheon.<BR>The honored dead, including Bane, Bhaal, Moander, Myrkul,
and Leira, among others.<BR>Expanded and clarified specialty priest
classes and specific spells for all relgions with priesthoods.<BR>Color

additional general priest classes now official to the FORGOTTEN REALMS
