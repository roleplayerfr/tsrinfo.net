<center><b><i>"Looking for adventure are ye?<BR>Looking for a place
brimming with silver and gold,<BR>a place dripping with things magical?</i></b></center><BR>
I know a place far and not far from here where all of that - and more -
can be had. But mind me lads and lassies, there are other things
there as well - danger and risk and uncertainty, and creatures never
before seen by the likes of sell-swords and wizards who tread upon the
sun-lit lands of the Realms.<BR><BR>"This place is called Undermountain.
And it is far beneath the crust of this world, yet right under fair
Waterdeep. It is a dangerous labyrinth nestled deep in the bowels of
the earth. It is a dungeon. I, Elminster of Shadowdale, know well. I
shall tell you of these twisting corridors, and of the man who made
them his. Listen ye carefully - especially if ye are intent on delving
into its depths. Perhaps what I tell you could save your life.<BR>
"Perhaps."<BR><BR>This sequel to <a href="ruins.htm">The
<i>RUINS OF UNDERMOUNTAIN</i></a> contains the 128-page Campaign Guide
to Undermountain: The Deep Levels, a 32-page adventure booklet, a
16-page MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM booklet, four full-color, poster-size maps
of the levels described in this boxed set, and a set of eight DM
Assistance Cards to aid in trapping the corridors and rooms of this, the
greatest and most dangerous dungeon in all the Realms.<BR><BR>The
original campaign expansion set wasn't enough? Well, then, pack your
gear and delve into Ruins of Undermountain II: The Deep Levels. The
deep-dwellers await!
