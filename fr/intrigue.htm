Greetings, kind travelers! The roads south to the Lands of Intrigue are
long and dusty indeed, but they are roads to greatness and glory for
merchants, adventurers, and scholars all. Folk with mettle enough to
brave these lands will be challenged and astounded by forms of power,
magic, and culture that are found nowhere else in Faerûn.<BR><BR>
Developed from out-of-print material originally found in <a href="fr3.htm">
FR3 <i>Empires of the Sands</i></a>, this expansion provides more than
150 pages of new information. What's inside:<BR><BR><b><i>Book One:
Tethyr</i></b> (96 pages) presents the many facets of Tethyr, from its
origin as an elven homeland through its rise and fall as a human
nation and up to its recent restoration from anarchy. While this
growing realm is now the safest of the Lands of Intrigue, it was once a
seat of the malevolent Empire of Shoon - whose influence still haunts
the golden plains in the form of roving monsters, wandering ghosts, and
the terrors of times past.<BR><BR><b><i>Book Two: Amn</i></b> (64 pages)
collates all that is Amn - or, as some call it, the Coinland. Money is
this countries lifeblood, whether gleaned from the trade along the
Sword Coast or the far-off colonies of New Amn. However, a dark dawn
has risen on those whose eyes see no further than their ledgers and
coin stacks....<BR><BR><b><i>Book Three: Erlkazar & Folk of Intrigue</i></b>
(32 pages) reveals the formerly undocumented domain of Erlkazar, east
of Tethyr - an area ready to be fleshed out by DMs to suit their
individual campaigns. <i>Book Three</i> also holds the secrets of the
hidden powers of the South, such as the Cowled Wizards, the Knights of
the Shield, the Shadow Thieves, and the undead sorcerors of the Twisted
Rune.<BR><BR>Two poster maps detail the Lands of Intrigue, the Pirate
Isles of the Nelanther, and the center of the long-dead Shoon Empire,
the monster-riddled ruins of Shoonach.<BR><BR>More than a dozen
additional maps depict all the cities of Amn and Tethyr, as well as
the distant Maztican colonies.
