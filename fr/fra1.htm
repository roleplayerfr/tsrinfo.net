The Horde is riding!<BR><BR>The mountains rumble under the thundering
hoofbeats of 40,000 barbaric horsemen. When the player characters
find themselves in their path they have no choice except to flee.<BR><BR>
Their journey takes them into the forbidden kingdom of Ra-Khati, a land
of ancient mysteries and untold wealth nestled deep within the Katakoro
Mountains. As honored guests they are invited to partake of its
extravagance. Wealth, power, romance - anything can be theirs for the
