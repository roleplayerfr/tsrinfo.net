At last! Complete in one catalog, all the finest merchandise Faerun
has to offer is presented by the enterprising entepreneur, Aurora the
Eclectic.<BR>Useful for players in any AD&D fantasy campaign (and other
role-playing games, too!), this is a handy listing of items and goods
of all kinds, from farming tools to scribes' pens, from imported Shou
Lung silks to Maztican cotton, from wines and ales to breads and
cheeses. Prices are given in the gold piece standard, for simple
conversion. Players' "shopping trips" will never be the same!<BR>It
is our hope that players and DMs will find this Catalogue both useful
and enjoyable. Aurora is not above editorializing about her wares, but
we think her opinions will be informative as well as entertaining.
