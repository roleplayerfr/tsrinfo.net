An ominous encounter with a fortuneteller sends a party of adventurers
on a 200-mile journey across the Lands of Intrigue. While traveling
through the townns and terrain (detailed here for the first time) that
lie in their path, they hear rumors and obtain clues about their
mission. Their ultimate destination is Castle Spulzeer, a once proud
stronghold that has become a den of terror.<BR><BR>When the heroes
enter the haunted keep, they meet a terrifying trio of residents: a
madman armed with stolen magical power, a lich whose secret laboratory
houses untold horrors and treasure, and a furious ghost bent on revenge.
These three ensnare the party in their fight over an ancient weapon.
Each will stop at nothing to keep it from the other two. The heroes
must choose with whom they will ally - and the wrong choice could lead
to their doom.<BR><BR><i>Castle Spulzeer</i> is an adventure complete
in itself. However, as a crossover story, it offers every Dungeon
Master a choice between two endings. The first leaves the part in the
Realms. The second transports the characters to the Demiplane of
Dread where the plot continues in the RAVENLOFT adventure <a href="../rv/rv-forgot.htm"><i>
The Forgotten Terror</i></a>.
