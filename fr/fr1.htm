The North...rugged mountains and dense forests, which hide many beings
hostile to man (who has settled here but lightly). Many dungeons and
ruins also lie hidden in the Northern wastes, relics of the former
splendor of the dwarven kingdoms, now lost and abandoned, and of
earlier, fallen kingdoms of men.<BR>Waterdeep...crossroads of the world,
City of Splendors. Here and wealth and goods from every corner of the
Realms, intrigue and feuds and important personages of rank and
influence. From the many-spired towers of Piergeiron's Palace to the
living, ever-changing city of Waterdeep, and suggests many adventures
therein.<BR>Partake of the sights, the bustle, and the intrigue - rub
shoulders with the powerful and famous - feast your eyes on fabled
treasures. Hear tales in the taverns such as can be heard nowhere
else in all the world - but keep your weapons ready and your wits
sharp. Oh, and above all...enjoy your stay.<BR><BR><BR><a href="fr1-a.htm">
