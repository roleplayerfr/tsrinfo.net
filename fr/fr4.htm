From Waterdeep and the Sword Coast to the jungles of Chult and the
faraway lands of Thay, strange and powerful magics fill the Forgotten
Realms. Ancient tomes, powerful spells, fearsome weapons - all these
and more await adventurers who can overcome terrible dangers to wield
great power.<BR>Ed Greenwood, originator of the Forgotten Realms game
world, and famous game designer Steve Perrin have spent many long days
with Elminster of Shadowdale, perhaps the finest sage in the long
history of Abeir-Toril. The result of all this work is in you hands;
<i>The Magister</i> is a compilation of new spells and items for your
Forgotten Realms campaign.<BR>Some of the new magics described in <i>The
Magister</i> were first published in numerous "Elminster" articles in
Dragon magazine. The best of these, along with many new fabulous spells
and items, appear in this volume.
