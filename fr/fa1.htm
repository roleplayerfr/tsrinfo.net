Someone in the misty, wooded Moonshae Isles needs hundreds of brand-new
swords taken under guard from Sword Coast smiths to a certain place on
the Isles.<BR>The swords are needed so badly, and their safe arrical is
considered so unlikely, that someone is willing to pay adventurers a
<i>lot</i> of gold - someone fairly important.<BR>Adventurers foolish
enough to take assigments too good to be true (or merely desperate for
coins) will soon find themselves embroiled in a drak and mysterious
struggle against evil that will take them into sacred groves, crumbling
castles, and through ancient magical gates to the halls of the High
King - and beyond.<BR><BR>This sourcebook contains background lore on
the Moonshaes, a DM's delight of new monsters, magic items, and spells
usable in any AD&D campaign and enough adventure ideas to keep the
most energetic player characters seeking their fortunes in the Moonshaes
for years to come!
