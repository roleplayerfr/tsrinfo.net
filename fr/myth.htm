<b>MYTH DRANNOR,</b> city of glory. We shall not see its like again.<BR><BR><b>
PERHAPS YOU'VE HEARD ITS SHINING STORY...</b>of a time when elves and
dwarves, gnomes and halflings and men lived and loved together, striving
to create beauty and right wrongs. Magic was brighter then, in the City
of Song. Folk were richer then, in the City of Wonder. Once this proud
city stood as the highest jewel in the glittering crown of civilization.<BR><BR><b>
THERE CAME A DAY</b> when it was overwhelmed by evil, thrown down,
despoiled, and left a ruin in the heart of its encircling wood, as all
things of beauty are.<BR>Evil spawned and crawled there, and the elves
kept watch around it, that evil might not spread. Centuries passed,
but the tales let few forget the powerful magic, the great treasure -
and the deadly horrors that lay waiting within its walls.<BR>Now the
elves are gone, and adventurers from a hundred lands and cities are
rushing to Myth Drannor, to seize what they can of the long-lost glory.
If the bards and sages are right, power lies there for the claiming
that could change the face of the Realms, rule kingdoms of lay waste to
them.<BR>If you would be a part of this exciting quest, this boxed set
is for you. Inside await four poster maps, eight cardsheets, eight
MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM sheets, and two booklets - a 128-page Campaign
Guide, and a 32-page Adventure Booklet - filled with details about
Myth Drannor, a fully-detailed campaign setting for high-level
characters in the world of the Forgotten Realms. New monsters and
magical items await to sparkle and challenge in any AD&D campaign - and
this set lays bare the secret at the heart of Myth Drannor: the fabled
mythal!<BR><BR>Don't be left by the fireside, listening, wistful and
poor. Join the rush for gems and gold, magic and power! Open this box,
and enter into fabled <i>Myth Drannor!</i>
