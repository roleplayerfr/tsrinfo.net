changes in the Forgotten Realms. Areas of dead magic and wild magic
have appeared; character classes have been altered; new magical spells
have been discovered; old gods have been slain and new ones arisen.

volume for FORGOTTEN REALMS players and dungeon masters alike. Get new
information on specialty priests, currency, new weapons, and treasure.
Take a detailed tour of the major cities of the heartland, from the
Sword Coast to the Dragon Reach, including the Moonsea, the Dalelands,
Cormyr, and Sembia. The most popular and intriguing fantasy world
ever published gets even better with this fantastic supplement.
