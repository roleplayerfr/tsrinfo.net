Faiths & Avatars</i></a>. which detailed the rules by which deities
function in the Realms, and describes more of the relgions and powers
of the Realms. Each divine power is covered in depth, and each entry

day-to-day activities of priests, holy days and important ceremonies,
major centers of worship, affiliated orders, and the priestly
