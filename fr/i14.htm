Ravening armies sweep across the land! Vast hordes of
foul monsters lay siege to mighty cities! Tremendous battles are fought
to decide the fate of entire lands - and <i>you</i> are in command!<BR>Swords
of the Iron Legion is an anthology of adventures set in the FORGOTTEN
REALMS campaign setting for large-scale battle using the <a href="../ad/bs.htm">BATTLESYSTEM</a>
rules for mass combat. The adventures, written by a group of talented
designers, range from simple skirmishes to all-out wars! Flying
creatures, war machines, fortifications, and plenty of other twists
ensure that each scenario is more than a simple bash-'em-up. Some
adventures also include role-playing oppurtunities for characters, who
get a chance to perform individual heroics to lead their armies to
victory!<BR>These adventures are suitable for one-time play, or they can
be inserted with ease into an existing campaign. Complete descriptions
of the armies, special characters, terrain, and other interesting
features to guarantee you hours of fun on a grand scale are included in
each adventure.
