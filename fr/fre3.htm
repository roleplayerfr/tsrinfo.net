The God of Strife is dead, destroyed in his attack on Tantras, and
Midnight and the player characters have recovered the first Tablet of
Fate - one of a pair of mysterious artifacts that will return the gods
to their former glory and save the Realms from the fallen deities' wrath.<BR><BR>
But the quest isn't over! To find the other Tablet of Fate, your
heroes must travel across Faerun to Waterdeep, the City of Splendors.
But both Midnight's former ally, Cyric, and Myrkul, the Lord of the Dead,
want the tablets for their own dark ends, and they will stop at nothing
to capture Midnight even if it means the destruction of the Realms!<BR><BR>
<i>Waterdeep</i> is the third of a three-part series of adventures for
the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS 2nd Edition role-playing game, but it
can also stand alone. Set in the popular FORGOTTEN REALMS game world,
this adventure is loosely based on Richard Awlinson's <i>Waterdeep</i>,
the third novel in the Avatar Trilogy. This adventure is designed for
four to six player characters of levels 6 to 9.
