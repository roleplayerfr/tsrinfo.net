This esential supplement is a companion to <a href="faiths.htm"><i>
Faiths & Avatars</i></a> and <a href="powers.htm"><i>
Powers & Pantheons</i></a>, which detailed the rules by which deities
function in the Realms. <i>Demihuman Deities</i> describes the demihuman
relgions and powers of the Realms: those of the elves (including the
drow), the dwarves, the gnomes and the halflings. Each entry includes
information about a deity's appearance, personality, worshipers,
portfolio, aliases, domain name, superior, allies, foes, symbol,
worshipers' alignments, avatar, manifestations, church, and specialty
priests. The information on these faiths includes their core dogma,
day-to-day activities of priests, holy days and important ceremonies,
major centers of worship, affiliated orders, and the priestly
vestaments and adventuring garb of members of the clergy. Finally,
each entry contains spells specific to each of the faiths.<BR><BR><b><i>
