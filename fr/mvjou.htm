<i>Marco Volo - Journey</i> is the second volume of the <i>Marco Volo</i>
trilogy, designed for four to eight player characters of 6th-8th level.
This free-wheeling adventure began in Waterdeep as the characters set
out on an intrigue-laden journey to Shadowdale. Accompanying them is
Marcus Wands (known as "Marco Volo"), a bothersome but likeable rogue.<BR><BR>
After leaving the Way Inn, the party heads for the Chauntean Monastery
near Berdusk, where they have been promised safe shelter. Arriving at
the monastery, all seems pastoral and pleasant... but of course, things
are never quite that simple.<BR><BR>After escaping from the monastery,
the PCs run afoul of King Azoun's Purple Dragons on the lookout for the
infamous thief, Marco Volo. Only the timely intervention of a band of
wandering entertainers enables the party to continue on its way.<BR><BR>
While on the road with Heino's Woodland Troupe, the characters learn
the joys of being in a traveling repertory company, performing for a
different audience each night. In the course of the adventure, the PCs
also learn more about Marcus and his secrets - some of his secrets,
anyway. There's still the matter of the mysterious letter, and that
powerful artifact from another plane, the <i>Dragonking's Eye</i>.<BR><BR>
The adventure ends with Shadowdale in sight not to be reached, however,
without a final confrontation with the notorious mage-assassin Felibarr
Blacklance.<BR><BR>This volume of the <i>Marco Volo</i> trilogy offers
DMs the oppurtunity to run unusual encounters, and it calls for
considerable role playing from all. Player characters cannot easily
rely on their swords and spells to get them out of the brawls and
misunderstandings that arise. What results is a dramatic but
picaresque enterprise as the adventure continues!
