Behold the newest, brightest, and perhaps best travel guide by the
world-walking, all-seeing Volo! Fresh from recounting the splendors of
Cormyr, the Forest Kingdom, and circumnavigating all of Toril in a bold
and wondrous adventure that none have equaled for its haste and humor,
the tireless Volo has come at last to the beautiful Dales of the
Dragonreach in the Heartlands of the Realms and set forth his florid
account of things to see, things to do... and things to avoid. Many of
the finest establishments and most striking sites and landmarks of the
Dales are featured here, ranked with the handy coin, dagger, pipe, and
tankard rating system. Volo has identified the best and the worst, so
you need waste no precious time nor coins of your own to discovering
just which attraction best suits your taste.<BR><BR>Discover:<BR>Where
to find caverns whose walls sparkle with gems.<BR>The way into the
tombs of the Twelve Dancing Wizards - and why they dance.<BR>The curse
that lies on several barrow tombs and why it was laid.<BR>Where one
might find the Talking Bone and what it does.<BR>Why it is best not to
move any of the Chessmen of Valsprendar.<BR>Where to find a door that
opens into a room halfway across Faerûn - and why it should be used
only with extreme caution.<BR><BR><i>Suitable for all levels of play.</i><BR><BR>
<i>Special Note:</i> This edition of <i>Volo's Guide to the Dalelands</i>,
intended for travelers from beyond the borders of Faerûn, contains
notes, commentary, and substantial revisions by the famous sage and
archmage Elminster of Shadowdale.
