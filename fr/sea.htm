<center><b>Calimshan and the Lake of Steam Revealed!</b></center><BR>
The dusty trails from the North have brought you to the warm and
welcoming coasts of the Shining Sea and the Lake of Steam. Here is
history spanning millennia, not just centuries; passion, profit and
danger; dreams of power and conquest; and wonders mysteries centuries
older than any hedge realm north of Dalagar's Road and the Snowflake
Mountains.<BR><BR><i>Empires of the Shining Sea</i> goes farther and
deeper into the southern reaches of the FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign
setting, providing a breadth of scope and a level of detail never
before published. This boxed set includes a 192-page book filled with
information on these topics:<BR><BR><b>History</b> The Empires of the
Shining Sea hold tales and legends passed down by word of mouth across
the years. The myriad mysteries and dramas of more than 300 rulers
across four empires - including the infamous Shoon Imperium - reveal
themselves in the history and timeline spanning more than 8,000 years.<BR><BR><b>
Calimshan</b> The long-fallen empire of Calimshan rises yet again, as
a new ruler and new power groups take control of the former land of the
genies. Updated and expanded by more than 100 pages since its first
appearance in <a href="fr3.htm">FR3, <i>Empires of the
Sands</i></a>, Calimshan shows itself to be a land bent on returning to
its former greatness - at any and all costs!<BR><BR><b>The Land of the
Lions</b> This rugges land sandwiched between the Deepwash and the
Lake of Steam seems empty, but many surprises lurk among its plains
and woods - nomands and raiders astride giant lynxes, elder orbs,
ruined cities, lost cultures, and more!<BR><BR><b>The Lake of Steam</b>
This steaming bay of the Shining Sea unveils its secrets, proving that
it holds more than easy trade routes to the Inner Sea. Scarlet pearls
the size of a human fist or the smoking majesty of the volcanic
Arnrock tempt those who dare test its deceptively calm waters.<BR><BR>
Also inside are two full-color poster maps showing Calimshan and the
Lake of Steam region at 30-mile-per-inch scale.<BR><BR><center>Everything
you need to adventure in the conspiracy-laden Empires of the Shining
Sea is here!</center>
