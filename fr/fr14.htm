<i>"A village is only as livable as its surroundings. We are caretakers
not only of our homes, but of our world."<BR>-Inum<BR></i>Strange
sentiments, perhaps, from one who lives in what many perceive as a 
frozen wasteland, but the philosopher Inum speak for the Ulutiun people
of the Great Glacier. Their tribes share that icy landscape with arctic
dwarves who enjoy sun-bathing, sled-animals that are hardier than dogs,
and fierce monsters that live nowhere else - and thrive in the freezing
air.<BR><i>The Great Glacier</i> is the first supplement for the
Forgotten Realms campaign setting to detail an Inuit-based culture. In
this booklet is fact-based information on building a snow-house,
suviving in sub-zero temperatures for extended periods of time, and
more ideas for fantasy campaigning in an arctic setting. For those who
are tired of the normal, temperate, "you-meet-in-the-tavern-and-proceed-to-go-adventuring"
games, here's something completely different.<BR>Make sure your
characters dress warmly - it gets nippy at night on the Great Glacier.
