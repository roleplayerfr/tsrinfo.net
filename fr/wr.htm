From Waterdeep to Thay, from the great Glacier to Calimshan, wizards
and rogues dress, think, and behave in ways that tell the learned
observer just where they hail from. Sometimes the differences are
obvious - anyone can distinguish a seafaring mage from a
turban-crowned spellcaster, or a thief of Lantan from a burglar of Amn.
But often, appearance gives no clue: even wizards and rogues of the
Dalelands vary from Dale to Dale, though one may look the same as
another. Faerûnians are fiercely proud of their heritage, and they
carry their native traits with them wherever they go.<BR>Within these
pages are dozens of kits designed to help players in a FORGOTTEN REALMS
campaign discover their characters' roots and reflect them in
role-playing. Special benefits and disadvantages related to each
particular home town or territory allow players to create unique kits
that can be applied to mages, specialist wizards, and rogues, and they
can even be layered over other kits. As a bonus, two new player
character subclasses have been included: the intriguing <i>spellsinger</i>
and the stealthy <i>shadow walker</i>.
