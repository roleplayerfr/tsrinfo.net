Fighters and clerics have long been mainstays in many AD&D game
campaigns. Now, take a look inside this book and discover the dozens
of kits created to adapt these basic classes to the unique and popular
lands of Faerûn. Learn what a difference your homeland makes when you
choose a warrior's kit, or discover the benefits as well as
disadvantages of worshiping certain gods of the Realms. Some differences
among people are subtle, while others can be quite glaring. This tome
reveals ways to identify whether a mercenary hails from Chondath or
Waterdeep. It tells you that not all black-clad priests are evil
followers of Cyric, and even priests of the demipowers have skills to
respect.<BR>In addition to priest and warrior kits, unique PC
subclasses are revealed herein: the Harper, roving guardian of nature
and justice, and the Crusader, a militant priest able to defend the
faith with steel if necessary. As sure as Elminster's pipe glows
green, the true warriors and priests of the Realms stand revealed at
last!
