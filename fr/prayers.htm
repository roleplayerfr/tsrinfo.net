Ever wonder why priesthoods in the Realms continue to flourish, despite
the secular power of rich merchants and the land-shattering spells of
the archmages?<BR><BR>The answer lies in the mighty spells heretofore
kept concealed by the robed clery of the cloisters. These sacred spells
are now revealed in these pages, drawn from legendary holy books
presently "lost" on Faerûn. To read <i>Prayers From the Faithful</i>
is to know holy awe and blessed fear at last!<BR><BR>Learn the
long-suppressed secrets of:<BR><BR>Which gems to place into the eye
sockets of the carved faces on <i>Gorothir's Girdle</i> to call forth
deadly magics.<BR><BR>The hallowed album that was used to slay six
dragons - and now bears the unblinking, preserved eye of one of them.<BR><BR>
The divine tome that is a gem that served to lure and slay thieves for
over 30 years.<BR><BR>Why it's dangerous to hold the <i>Chanting Chain</i>
carelessly - and what wakens to its chants.<BR><BR>And much more!
<i>Prayers From the Faithful</i> is an essential guide to the magic of
priests in the FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign world, and a useful aid to
those portraying priests in any ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS campaign.<BR><BR>
