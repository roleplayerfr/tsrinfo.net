On the Night of Wailing, when the creatures of Viperhand come to life,
when the great Maztican gods Qotal and Zaltec battled, the great Cloak
of One Plume - a magical item of great power and a token of great
authority - was believed lost forever.<BR><BR>Such was not the case.<BR><BR>
Rumors fly that the Cloak was rescued that night, and hidden away in a
safe location. Now a petty noble of New Amn plans to recover it, and
is looking for brave young souls who can bring it back to him. But
other players are invovled in the chase, trying to recover the lost
Cloak.<BR><BR><i>Fires of Zatal</i> spans the great continent of Maztica
from the new colony of Helmsport to the Valley of Nexal, at the foot of
Mt. Zatal itself. It is the first adventure for the new <i>Maztica</i>
campaign setting in the Realms; DMs wishing to run this need the <a href="maz.htm"><i>
Maztica</i> Campaign Boxed Set</a>. This module serves as an introduction
to this new world of adventure, a land of wise and savage empires and
growing, monstrous threats.<BR><BR>Welcome to Maztica. This is not the
Realms you're familiar with!
