From the storm-lashed rocks west of fabled Evermeet to the Plains of
Purple Dust, all the folk of Faerun have heard of the Harpers.<BR>
Noble fools, some call them. Crazy, misguided meddlers, others say.
Still others disagree. "The one true hope of the Realms," said one
princess. "A shining light in the darkness of out lives," agreed a
sage, "pray that it never goes out."<BR>Just who are these mysterious,
wandering folk who wear silver harp pins and walk softly in the most
dangerous shadows of the Realms?<BR>This book reveals the secrets,
rules, and magic of the Harpers, including:<BR>Harpers Runes<BR>Harper
Magic<BR>The long, colorful History of the Harpers<BR>Their evil Foes<BR>
Their special Allies<BR>The fabled High Heralds<BR>What Harpers Do<BR>
Harper Haunts: their strongholds, and the Harpers who (literally)
haunt them!<BR>Joining the Harpers, and how to become a True Harper and
a Master Harper...<BR><BR>...And more, from favorite Harper ballads to
detailed Harper NPCs. This is a sourcebook you'll turn to again and
again. It lays bare the warring power groups who work behind the scenes
in Faerun; no FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign is complete without it!.
