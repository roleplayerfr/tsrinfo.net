"Far be it from me to impugn the mettle of adventurers such as yourselves,
but daring the depths of Undermountain merely for fortune's sake is more
absurd than kicking a sleeping dragon in the nose for sport. Even so,
you've returned for another trip to the Underhalls, so be prepared. You
stand to enter the Lost Level this time - gird yourselves for diplomacy
as well as destruction. You'll find the last stronghold of an extinct
dwarven clan - do be good enough to extend the greetings of the Blackstaff
to Bandaerl. There's also a dark vampiress who enjoys a good hunt, and
be sure to mind the beholders - they're trained to keep you from escaping.
Enjoy, and don't say Khelben didn't warn thee."<BR><BR>This DUNGEON
CRAWL adventure includes 32 pages of combat and role-playing
hearkening back to classic AD&D dungeons of old. This is a stand-alone
module and does not require additional support materials. It can
easily be inserted into a campaign on any world, but best fits an
Undermountain or Waterdeep campaign within the Realms.
