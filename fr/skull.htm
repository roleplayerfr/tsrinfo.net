Skullport, the Port of Shadow, is perhaps the best kept secret in all
the Sword Coast North. A mile and a half beneath the orderly streets
of Waterdeep squats the most wretched and lawless pits of thieves,
buccaneers, slavers, and sellswords the Realms has to offer. Under a
moldering tangle of catwalks threaded between the stalactites and
stalagmites of the cavern city, illithids, drow, beholders, and others
plot and trade with emissaries from the surface. Monsters prowl the
dark recesses and alleyways, gangs of zombies shamble about performing
menial labor, and anything and everything can be bought and sold:
lethal poisons, foul tomes of forbidden magic, and slaves.<BR><BR>The
only law is meted out by the enigmatic Skulls of Skullport, mysterious
floating humanoid skulls whose capricious judgments and madness-induced
destructiveness are the stuff of grisly travelers' tales. Gold rules
the ever-present twilight, and only those with keen eyes and blades may
keep it long.<BR><BR>This 96-page book contains:<BR><BR>Maps and
general information about the three layers and four wards of Skullport.<BR>
Descriptions of over 100 notable sites in the wards.<BR>A partial map
of the dungeons of Skullport - where the Skulls throw the folk they let
live!<BR>Descriptions of notable NPCs and power groups of Skullport.<BR><BR>
Although no other FORGOTTEN REALMS setting products are required to use
<i>Skullport</i>, this accessory can be used to provide supplemental
information for the <a href="ruins.htm"><i>Ruins of
Undermountain</i></a> campaign expansion. Dungeon Masters can also use <i>
SKullport</i> as a basis for an UNDERDARK city in their own campaigns.
