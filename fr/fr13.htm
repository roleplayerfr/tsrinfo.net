The Great Desert. Where The Winds Wail. Grave of The Lost Princes.
The Great Sand Sea. Not a place many sane folk in the Forgotten Realms
want to visit. But there are plenty of the other sort, who come hence
to find wonders both beautiful and dangerous.<BR>The deadly, shifting
sands of Anauroch hide - and occasionally, tantalizingly reveal - the
riches and strange treasures of The Lost Kingdoms, swallowed long ago.
The legendary wealth of The Cities of Gold lies somewhere in its sandy
depths.<BR>So, too, do worse things: fell monsters, famous in
adventurers' tales (and listeners' nightmares) across the Realms. Evil,
crawling magic whose counterspells have been long forgotten, whose
death slumbers lightly, ever-ready to awaken and strike down the unwary
intruder.<BR>In the pages of this sourcebook, Anauroch comes to life.
Its dark, innermost secrets are revealed, and the colorful cultures of
the Bedine - and beings far worse - are explored. This guide to the
most important "forgotten" land of the Forgotten Realms presents new
rules galore: new spells, new adventures, new monsters - and much, much
more.
