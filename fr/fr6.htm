The Red Wizards of Thay. As cruel and horrible as they are powerful,
they have ruled their eastern realm for as long as any sage can
remember. They can be powerful allies, or deadly enemies. The Red
Wizards know the darkest secrets of the strongest magic, and will sell
their skills to the highest bidder. Thay is a land of slavers and
tyrants, of intrigue and murder, of danger and oppurtunity. In this
book, the government, personalities, economy, cities, people, and
wilderness of Thay are described for an AD&D campaign of any size or
level. <i>Dreams of the Red Wizards</i> also includes new spells and
magical items unique to the Red Wizards, plus a four-color map of Thay
that can be added to the previously published maps of the Forgotten
Realms!
