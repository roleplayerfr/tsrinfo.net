Beautiful, powerful, mysterious, and deadly - the silver-haired Seven
Sisters are legendary throughout the Forgotten Realms.<BR>One rules the
city of bards, Silverymoon. Another is Elminster's beloved and the
infamous Witch-Queen of Aglarond. The third is the Lady Mage of
Waterdeep, peer and consort of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, and the
fourth is a Harper and one of the famous Knights of Myth Drannor. The
fifth is a leader of the Harpers and a legendary bard in her own right,
and the sixth is a dead - perhaps undead - witch. And the seventh?
She's the one who wild tales are whispered about all across Faerûn
around many a fireside late at night.<BR>But who are they, really?
Their very names conjure up romance, allure, and power - Storm
Silverhand, the Simbul, High Lady Alustriel. Sages say they are among
the Chosen of Mystara, archmages who wield magic few can dare to
stand against. Yet these seven do not seek to rule the world, and
they often stay quiet and hidden for generations.<BR>That hints at
another thing. These seven seem immortal, never aging as the long years
pass. Just who are these Seven Sisters, and what are their secrets?<BR>
Read this tome, and learn what the Zhentarim, the Red Wizards of Thay,
and the Cult of the Dragon could not, despite performing many fell
deeds in the attempt. Learn the stories of these great ladies, and
their aims and strivings - and browse among over a hundred new and
spectacular spells! Dungeon Masters and players alike will find this
volume an essential sourcebook of Realmslore, and a handy guide to
archsorceresses peerless in power.
