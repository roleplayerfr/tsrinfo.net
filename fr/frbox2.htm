It is a world where the gods have walked and fantastic armies clashed.
It is the home of Elminster, Alias, Azoun, Khelben, and Drizzt the dark

the DUNGEON MASTER, showing how to create a Realms campaign, and giving
details about secrets, NPCs, and deities of the Realms.<BR><BR><i>
Shadowdale</i> - a 96-page book, presenting the most important town in
the Realms as the basis of an ongoing campaign, including a <i>new</i>
introductory adventure, "Beneath the Twisted Tower."<BR><BR><i>8
MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM</i> pages covering the deadliest creatures of the
Realms!<BR><BR><i>6 card sheets</i> showing nearly 100 signs, trail
glyphs, symbols, magical sigils, and religious symbols of the Realms in
full color.<BR><BR><i>4 all-new</i> four-color maps, 2 of eastern and
western Faerun, and two smaller-scale, detailed maps of the heartlands
of the Realms.<BR><BR>The revised FORGOTTEN REALMS <i>Campaign Setting</i>

earlier boxed set, not to be missed by either long-time fans or
