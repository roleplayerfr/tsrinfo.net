Setting for the Icewind Dales trilogy of novels (<i>The Crystal Shard,
Streams of Silver</i>, and the upcoming <i>Halfling's Gem</i>), and
the H-series of adventure modules which culminated in a battle with
Orcus himself, the Bloodstone Lands are one of the wildest areas of the
Forgotten Realms.<BR>In this sourcebook, the author of the Icewind Dales
trilogy explores this frozen region. Presented for players and DMs
alike are people, places, and events that shaped the Bloodstone Lands -
the political movers and shakers who carved their own brand of
civilization from rocks and ice. In addition to this insider
information, there are 10 new adventure scenario suggestions for all
levels of play, from beginner to advanced, allowing campaigning in the
Bloodstone Lands to continue long after exploring the mines and
conquering Orcus.<BR>Prepare then to enter the barbaric kingdoms of
Vaasa and Damara - the Bloodstone Lands.
