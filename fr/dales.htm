The <i>Sword of the Dales</i>, an icon of the Dalelands symbolizing the
unity and strength of the people, has reappeared! Created by Shraevyn
the weapon-mage hundreds of years ago, the lost <i>Sword</i> had
become nothing more than a fantastic children's tale - until now.<BR><BR>
A group of warriors led by Randal Morn, rightful ruler of Daggerdale,
rushed to the <i>Sword's</i> resting place to recover it, but dark
forces awaited them, and Randal and his men fell to an ambush. Only
one man escaped, yet he brought with him the hope that Randal Morn yet
lives. Resolved to rescue his leader, that lone survivor turned to the
great Elminster of Shadowdale for aid.<BR><BR>But Elminster is gone,
off plane-hopping while the fate of Daggerdale hangs in the balance.
Hence, it is up to Lhaeo, scribe to the old mage, to find a group of
heroes who have mettle enough to face down the menace which claimed
Randal Morn and his hearty followers...<BR><BR>This is the first of
three adventures that grant player characters to oppurtunity to
determine the fate of Daggerdale. The saga continues with <a href="spider.htm"><i>
The Secret of Spiderhaunt</i></a> and concludes with <a href="morn.htm"><i>
The Return of Randal Morn</i></a>.
