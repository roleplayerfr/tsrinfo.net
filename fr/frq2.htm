Dragonspear Castle. All who live within several hundred miles have
heard the bame and know its import. Once home to the proud and the
brave, it stands now a ruin, cloaked behind a history of murder and
diabolic plots. Few go there, for the only reward to be found is
death.<BR>Rumors abound that Dragonspear holds a portal to the sinister
planes, but until now those have been unfounded. Following a great
battle against orcs and trolls from the High Moor who had taken
possession of the castle, a temple to ward against further evil was
established. However, by the Time of Troubles, that temple and its
clergy had disappeared. Now, a horde of fiends and monsters has
amassed at Dragonspear Castle, and is terrorizing the surrounding
countryside.<BR>The portal is active, that is for certain. The army
of Daggerford needs reinforcements! Is your party made of the stuff
of heroes?<BR><BR><i>Hordes of Dragonspear</i> can be played using
either the <a href="../ad/bs2.htm">BATTLESYSTEM</a> miniatures
rules, or the quick combat resolution system found in <a href="../ad/dmgr2.htm">
DMGR2</a>, <a href="../ad/dmgr2.htm"><i>The Castle Guide</i></a>.
Alternatively, a few simple changes render the entire module playable
without any special rules.
