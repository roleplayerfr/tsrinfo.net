No longer can the members of the most infamous clandestine organizations
in all the Realms lurk in their comfortable shadows. No more can
these men, women, dragons, dracoliches, and...others...scheme to
subjugate all that is good and true while the rest of Faerûn waits
unaware. For centuries has the evil secreet society founded by the mad
mage and Chosen of Mystara, Sammaster, labored secretly - well, no more!<BR><BR>
This 128-page book lays bare the secrets of Sammaster and the secret
society he created over 400 years ago. Herein is written the story of
the Cult of the Dragon, beginning with its foundation based on an
obscure line in a tome of ancient prophecy. Learn of the Cult's most
powerful current cells, their leaders, the dragons and dracoliches
that work with them (or for them), and their goals. Discover the many
foes the Cult has earned in over four centuries of treachery and
industrious malevolent dealings. Also included are the details of some
of the spells and magical items of the Cult and its dragons and
dracoliches, including the one item that no Cult member will ever admit
the existence of, much less claim to possess.<BR><BR>Read about the
many magical variant and hybrid creatures that the Cult uses to
excercise its will across the face of Faerûn. And finally, decide the
best way to incorporate the Cult into a FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign by
browsing the numerous adventure hooks for just the right scenario to
tempt and terrify players of any gaming style.
