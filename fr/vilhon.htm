The Reach has always been considered the breadbasket of the Realms, the
birthplace of countless warriors who have shed their lifeblood on the
fields of battle. It's also home to noble families that have ruled
kingdoms for countless generations, lizardman cities that have existed
for hundreds of years, and an ancient plague that still haunts the
land.<BR><BR>
Take a trip to Hlondeth, the yuan-ti city that stands like an emerald
beacon over the waters of Vilhon. Visit the gladiatorial arena of
Hlath or plunge into the depths of the Deepwash. Feel the political
tension that hovers over Shining Arrabar like a poised dagger. But always
remember that in the Reach, as in all lands that adventurers tread, not
all is as it appears.<BR><BR>
This FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign accessory contains a full-color poster
map fo the Vilhon Reach as well as new artwork that brings the reach to
life. A 64-page accessory for the Dungeon Master details the lengthy
history of the Vilhon, as well as providing current information on the
various countries and city-states. A 32-page travelogue provides
background for players whose characters would try their hand at
adventuring in the Vilhon Reach.
