<b>"So, thee say there be beasts out there thee've ne'er heard of nor
encountered? 'Tis easily enough repaired - provided thee've the
stomach for it!"<BR>-Elminster, the Sage of Shadowdale</b><BR><BR>TSR's
most popular world just became even better! Here are over 30 exciting

All lie in wait for intrepid adventurers of every level. All scenarios
are ready to play, with little or no preparation by the DM!<BR><BR>
Enjoy making the acquaintance of beasties from all parts of the Realms,
from alguduirs to dimensional warpers, inquisitors to revenants,

not-so-ugly) - they're all here, ready to encounter your party!<BR><BR>

Setting</a> and the <a href="mc11.htm">FORGOTTEN REALMS
MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM Appendices</a> are necessary to fully enjoy this
product.<BR><BR>Oh, and one more thing: DMs and players should be aware
of this famous corollary to Elminster's Rules of the Rabbit:<BR><i>
Sometimes a rabbit is just a rabbit.</i><BR>And sometimes, it's much,
much more....
