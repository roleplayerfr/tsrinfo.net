The battle between the mighty undead army of the Witch-King of Vaasa
and the forces of Bloodstone has come to a standstill. As long as the
source of the Witch-King's power is at work, his evil forces will
never be defeated!<BR>As the rulers of Bloodstone Pass, it is up to you
to find and destroy the source of Vaasa's power. All you have to do is
journey to the Abyss, confront the mightiest demon of all, steal the
<i>Wand of Orcus</i>, and take it to the Seven Heavens to be destroyed.<BR>
<i>The Throne of Bloodstone</i> is the fourth and final installment in
a series of modules specially designed for high-level characters.
While it is not necessary to have played any of the three previous
modules, <i>The Throne of Bloodstone</i> is the climax of an epic
struggle for a kingdom against the forces of darkest evil. Recommended
for characters of levels 18-100, <i>The Throne of Bloodstone</i> is the
highest-level adventure ever published by TSR!
