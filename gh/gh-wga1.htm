The Free City of Greyhawk beckons. Touted as the Gem of the Flanaess,
it offers excitement and adventure in the form of magic to be learned,
deals to be made, and streets to be explored. But wait - something
else lurks here that threatens adventurers at every turn. Is someone
following youu - or is it your imagination? Why is your party receiving
threats - you've been in town only a few days!<BR>Something evil <i>does</i>
lurk in Greyhawk. But before it can be eliminated, it must first be
discovered. Can your party find it before it finds you?<BR><i>Falcon's
Revenge</i> is the first of a three-part series of adventures for the
ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS 2nd Edition role-playing game, but it can
also stand alone. Set in the famed City of Greyhawk, it gives
adventurers a taste of life in the big city - with <i>someone</i> or
<i>something</i> brewing trouble.<BR><i>Falcon's Revenge</i> is designed
for five to seven characters of levels 5 to 7.
