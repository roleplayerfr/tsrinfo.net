Deep beneath the keep of Castle Greyhawk, a really nasty device is
creating all these gross, mutated, andd unpleasant monsters that are
running wild throughout the castle and the 12-level dungeon beneath
the castle. The call has gone out for heroic, fearless, and kinda
foolish adventurers to out-hack, out-slash, and sometimes even
out-think hordes of doughmen, headless mice, manic bee queens, really
bad dead things, burgermen, crazed chefs, and movie moguls. If they
survive these and much odder obstacles, the characters still have to
findd the nasty monster creator and put it out of business.<BR><i>
Castle Greyhawk</i> contains 13 detailed levels for adventuring and
exploration. Each level is a seperate adventure written by a different
author and each has its own unique brand of insane and baffling
weirdness. Some levels involve solving puzzles and some require good
old hacking and slashing. The adventures can be played seperately or
all together as a grand quest to free Castle Greyhawk from the evil,
rotten hordes that are plaguing it. The common theme to this dungeon
is that no joke is so old, no pun is so bad, and no schtick is so
obvious that it can't be used to confuse and trip up PCs!<BR><BR><center>
