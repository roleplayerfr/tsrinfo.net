<center><b>The Lost Tombs, Volume 2</b></center><BR><BR>The lich
Lyzandred: a madman, an undead archmage, a survivor of the twin
cataclysms that destroyed two great empires. His name invokes
fear in the hearts of the smallest children, the bravest warriors,
and the wisest sages. Like a malicious cat, the lich toys with all
who stumble into his maze, tormenting them with strange puzzles and
obscure riddles, monsters and demons, weird traps and dangerous
magics. All who enter the crypt of Lyzandred find themselves
scarred with his rune, proof of their visit - and of their folly.<BR><BR>
But there is a method to the madness of Lyzandred, a purpose to his
twisted games. If you're lucky, you might even live to learn about
it.<BR><BR>The Lost Tombs series begins with <a href="gh-star.htm"><i>
Star Cairns</i></a> (Volume 1) and concludes with <a href="gh-doom.htm"><i>
The Doomgrinder</i></a> (Volume 3). Each adventure is playable
seperately or they can be linked to form an epic-length story.
