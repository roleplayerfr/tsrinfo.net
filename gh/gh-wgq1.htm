The Great War may be over, but the battles continue. Rumors and facts
are often confused in the aftermath. Depending on who you listen to,
Prinzfeld is either under attack or perfectly safe. Turrosh Mak is on
his way, with hordes of orcs at his command - ridiculous, he would
never attempt an invasion at this time. Graf Twembly is being held
hostage, and near death - no, he's just under the weather and hasn't
felt like coming out of the castle lately. A dwarven prince has
requested your party's aid in quelling the coming invasion (if there
is one, of course). Do you take him at his honorable word, and gird
yourselves for battle? Or do you listen to the street talk, and take
the side of those who disbelieve the warmongering? Most importantly of
all: what if you make the wrong choice?<BR><BR><i>Patriots of Ulek</i>
is the first module following the release of <a href="gh-wars.htm"><i>
GREYHAWK Adventures Wars</i>, last year's landmark boxed wargame.
