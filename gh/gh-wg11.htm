First, you find yourselves in the Gnarley Wood, fending off minions of
the evil leprechaun who dwells there. Coming through this episode
with flying colors, you continue to the Free City of Dyvers, where
there has been a rash of break-ins at several inns. Who is responsible
for these crimes? Evidence leads you to believe that a full-sized
person can't have commited the burglaries - the apparent entrance
points are far too small, and the footprints aren't those of humans
or even demi-humans.<BR>It's up to you, adventurers, to solve this
mystery and collect the reward (if you can).<BR>This adventure is
adapted from two RPGA network tournaments.
