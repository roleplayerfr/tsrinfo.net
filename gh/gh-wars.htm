From the mad Malachite throne in Rauxes to the bejeweled city of Chendl
in Furyondy, the Flanaess is at war! In the east, Overking Ivid V
thirsts for conquest. Vatun, Great God of the North, meanwhile unites
the barbarians and Fists into a fearsome sorce. Not to be outdone, the
dread Iuz masses humanoids and fiends in the northwest. And the Scarlet
Brotherhood in the south hangs over all the Flanaess, pulling the
strings of war like a mad puppeteer.<BR><BR>Take command of the armies
yourself and change the dark course of history! Between two and six
players can battle, deciding the Flanaess's fate in diplomacy and war,
and leading armies and heroes across two full-color maps. Muster your
armies from over 300 counters, ranging from light infantry to dragons -
with your favorite demi-humans and monsters as well! With over 150
cards, you can search for treasure or mercenaries and receive the gods'
blessing (or curse) through special events. When the battle comes -
the times that try the souls of all - you'll want your armies backed
with the wisdom contained within the 32-page history of the actual war.
The boxed set also includes an easy-to-read 8-page book of rules, with
optional advanced rules for hard-core wargamers.<BR><BR>The Flanaess
awaits a heroic deliverer - or an oppressive overlord! Which will you
be?
