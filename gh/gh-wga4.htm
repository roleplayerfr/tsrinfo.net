"...and so, after the Rain of Colorless Fire, the One-Named-In-Whispers
ascended to the Spider Throne. In the third year of his ascendancy,
Burgred, King of the Mara, refused the tribute of heads the Whispered
One demanded. The One-Named-In-Whispers took only himself and Kas, his
evil counselor, and devastated the land of the Mara with his magic.
Burgred paid with his own head.<BR>"Upon their return, Kas struck against
his master, so that he might become the master of the Spidered Throne.
In the end, both were slain and good people rejoiced.<BR>"It is said
that not all of the evil lich was destroyed. So great was his power
that his Hand and Eye have lived on, working evil over the centuries...."<BR>
For centuries, Vecna - archmage, despotic tyrant, the most fearsome of
all liches - has been nothing but a fearful legend to the honest folk
of Greyhawk. Once the supreme master of all undead sorcerers, even
today his Hand and Eye are objects of immense power.<BR>Now something
evil is stirring in the lands around Greyhawk. The Hand and Eye of
Vecna have been found - and Vecna wants them back.
