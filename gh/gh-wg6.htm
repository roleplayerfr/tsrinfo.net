You stand before a great throne of lapis lazuli. The massive chamber
is also blue, even the air has an indigo quality, perhaps from the
strangely convoluted coils of smoke rising from the braziers of azure
metal. Encompassed by the great chair is a man whose presence inspires
awe, Tenser the Archmage.<BR>High above the City of Greyhawk, somewhere
upon the lonely south coast of the Nyr Dyv, you and your associates
trekked to answer a summons that could not be taken lightly. You are
about to begin a quest to a mysterious island where lies the fabled
Crook of Rao. Only the bravest can face the isle's obscure jungles, its
most fearsome monsters, and its ultimate secret. Can you survive where
even the mighty followers of Tenser have failed?<BR>Isle of the Ape is
a challenging adventure for high-level play. This adventure, designed
for the <a href="gh-wogbox.htm">WORLD OF GREYHAWK Campaign</a>,
is for use with <a href="../ad/ua.htm">Unearthed Arcana</a>.<BR><BR>
