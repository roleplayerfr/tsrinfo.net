Assaults on the City of Greyhawk by a vengeful cleric of Iuz have
terrified citizens and caused an exodus of residents. If this cleric
is allowed to continue her evil plans, Greyhawk will become little
more than a ghost town, ripe for the picking by the evil cleric's
followers.<BR>Volunteers are needed to hunt down the cleric and her
cult before she unleashes her undead minions into the streets of
Greyhawk - and it is only a matter of time before she claims the city
as her own!<BR><i>Flames of the Falcon</i> is the third of a three-part
series of adventures for the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS 2nd Edition
role-playing game. The trilogy began with <a href="gh-wga1.htm"><i>
Falcon's Revenge</i></a> and <a href="gh-wga2.htm"><i>
Falconmaster</i></a> - now the thrilling adventure concludes in this
module.<BR>This adventure can also be played as a stand-alone module.
Set in the famed City of Greyhawk, <i>Flames of the Falcon</i> is
designed for five to seven characters of levels 5 to 7.
