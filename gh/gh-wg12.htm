There's only one way to get there - through the Barrier Peaks. Once
you're there, you are confronted with armed guards, traps both magical
and mechanical, and legendary beasts...not to mention the wandering
necromancers.<BR>Why go in there? Because rules of neighboring
countries have asked you to persuade the Black One to help rout that
group of expatriate necromancers. They tried a coup, failed, and came
to the Vale of the Mage to hide - and, presumably, to regroup and ally
with the Black One. They may have gained the help of the Tree People,
as well; you won't know until (perhaps) it'll be too late to turn back.
It's a jungle in there...
