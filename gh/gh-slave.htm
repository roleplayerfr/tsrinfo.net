<center><b><i>Peril in the Pomarj</i></b></center><BR>It has been a
decade since the feared yellow sails of the Slavelords appeared in
harbors of Wild Coast towns - ten years since friends, family, and
loved ones were carried off in shackles to the inhuman lands of the
Pomarj.<BR><BR>Turrosh Mak, a half-orc warlord, has unified the
bickering humanoid tribes into a rapacious nation! With sword and
flame, tooth and claw, he led his conquering horde north, till over
half of the Wild Coast fell beneath his iron gauntlet.<BR><BR>Now the
ships with the yellow sails have reappeared on the waters of the
Woolly Bay. They have even reached the shores of the Nyr Dyv, the
"lake of unknown depths," striking suddenly and carrying off every
able-bodied survivor. And just as suddenly they vanish without a
trace. The scourge of the Slavelords has returned.<BR><BR>This book
features a new chapter in the Slavelords saga, and includes detailed
descriptions of the cities and lands of the Flanaess, from the City of
Dyvers to the dark peaks of the Drachensgrab Mountains deep in the
Pomarj.
