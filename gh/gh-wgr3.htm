"In the agonizing aftermath of the Greyhawk wars, when conflict
touched virtually every corner of the continent, few gained more infamy
than Rary of the Circle of Eight. Once considered a quiet, peaceful
man with few ambitions, the great mage instead was corrupted to the
ways of evil, and in the process slew two of the wisest and most
powerful wizards of the Flanaess. Now, fleeing south with his
co-conspirator and their loyal troops, he has carved out an empire in
the wilderness, and threatens to inflict more harm and chaos on a
world long grown weary of war and strife."<BR>Thus begins this
supplement for the GREYHAWK campaign setting, the first since the
world-shattering <a href="gh-wars.htm"><b>GREYHAWK Wars</b></a>
boxed game. Descriptions of Rary's desert fortress in the Brass Hills
are here, as are statistics on his co-conspirator, Lord Robilar. The
back-breaking mines of Abbor Alz, home to the duergar, and the Ghost
Tower of Inverness are detailed as well, along with dozens of other
places, things, and persons. A four-color poster map of the Bright
Desert and its surroundings is also included.<BR>It is not necessary
to have played the <a href="gh-wars.htm"><b>GREYHAWK Wars</b></a>
boxed game in order to use this material.<BR>The campaign material
contained in this booklet is suitable for players and referees of all
levels; the adventures, however, are aimed at characters of levels 8
and up.
