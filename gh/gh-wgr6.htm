Glory - or a fate worse than death - in the World of Greyhawk!<BR><BR>
The dreadful jails below the appalling City of Skulls, Iuz's nightmare
capital, contain many wretched and desperate captives. Among them is
Earl Holmer, Knight Commander of the Shield Lands. A brave spy in
Dorakaa has shown the ay to find and free Holmer - is your party up to
the job of freeing him? King Belvor IV of Furyondy believes so. In
the way stand fearsome priests and mages of the Lord of Pain; ogres,
giants, fiends, and worse hinder the struggle to defeat traps and
guardians of Iuz. Plucking Holmer from his grasp will bring great
renown, knighthood, and treasure - for those who survive. None has
ever escaped Iuz's jails. Who will you be the first to use stealth or
storm to breach them?<BR><BR><i>The City of Skulls</i> presents
adventure with a mighty challenge, full of dangers writ large and
also unseen (until they strike). This adventure is suitable for 6-8
characters of levels 9-12, and includes pregenerated characters
suitable for the quest, player handouts, a unique Notoriety system
enabling the DM to draw forth Iuz's most fearsome guardians, a
multi-level dungeon-jail, and much more besides. Now is the time for
true heroes - is your party skillful enough to survive and return in
triumph??
