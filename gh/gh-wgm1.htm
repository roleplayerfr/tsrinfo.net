Greatwall is in peril - not from military forces of Iuz, but from lack
of goods and supplies. Caravans from Willip have ceased thanks to
increased dangers on the Willip Critwall Grabford Trail. As the key
fort positioned to contain the Iuzian flood, Greatwall is a strategic
necessity. Its failure would mean a major incursion along the border.<BR><BR>
Your characters are hired to escort a caravan from Greatwall to Willip;
if its merchants are afraid to come to the fort, the fort will go to
them. This should be simple, cut and dried guard job. Right?<BR>Of
course not. There are many surprises in store for your little caravan,
and your characters will need to keep their wits about them day and
night in order to make it to the other end. Secret plans are afoot,
conspiracies are brewing, and nothing is as it seems while on the
Border Watch.<BR><i><b>This module uses information presented in the <a href="gh-fta.htm">
