This collection of linked adventures takes characters from the Bandit
Kingdoms to Furyondy to the Wild Coast, with stops in some of Greyhawks
most exciting locales. But don't be fooled: This is more than just a
travelogue.<BR>A dread plague has struck the world of Greyhawk, and
the adventurers must travel the length and breadth of the land seeking
an explanation and a cure. This is no ordinary plague, but one that
seems almost like a punishment - or a test - meted out by some
greater power.<BR>Should the characters fail to uncover the secret of
this quest, the world of Greyhawk will be forever changed.<BR>This
epic campaign provides hitherto unknown details about the cities of
Greyhawk and tests each major character class in the AD&D game.
