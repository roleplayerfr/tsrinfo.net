It begins the night a dragon falls on an off-duty adventurer.
Fortunately, it's a small dragon. Unfortunately, it's connected to
a big problem. Make that a huge problem: The survival of a
well-known wizard belonging to the Circle of Five is at stake, but
that's not the worst of it. Evil forces are attempting to infiltrate
a secret fortress and unlock vast magical powers, but that's not the
worst, either.<BR><BR>The bad news? Some old enemies of civilization
in the Flanaess have returned, and they've discovered a mutual
interest in world domination. They have a plan to bring it about.
And their plan is already underway when the little dragon appears.<BR><BR>
Worse, on this particular nights, there's no one who can stop them -
no one but any heroes who can start this adventure and survive
through its out-of-this-world climax. And they have no choice. It
they fail, the City of Greyhawk and all the civilized lands of the
Flanaess will get to meet some remarkable legendary figures.<BR><BR>
Then civilization will die. Screaming.
