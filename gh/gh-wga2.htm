The discovery of an evil cult in the City of Greyhawk has caused city
officials to seek assistance in wiping out this new menace. Their
greatest worry? The cult's leader has disappeared, and officials fear
that she is simply gathering strength for her ultimate assault on the
city.<BR>Can your adventuring party find the cult's leader and put a
stop to her plans before she puts a stop to you?<BR><i>Falconmaster</i>
is the second of a three-part series of adventures for the ADVANCED
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS 2nd Edition role-playing game that began with <a href="gh-wga1.htm"><i>
Falcon's Revenge</i></a>. It can also be played as a stand-alone
module. Set in the famed City of Greyhawk, it gives adventurers a
taste of life in the big city - with <i>someone</i> or <i>something</i>
brewing trouble. <i>Falconmaster</i> is designed for five to seven
characters of levels 5 to 7.
