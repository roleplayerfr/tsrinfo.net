Barbarian legends tell of five magical blades of measureless power.
The more civilized cultures of warmer climes believe these tales to be
nothing more than delirious dreams of frost-bitten brains. "Those
frozen louts - they're trying to <i>scare</i> respect out of us!" At
least that's what they want to believe...<BR><BR>Three of the legendary
Blades of Corusk have been unearthed, and their powers have proven to
be all that the tales claimed. Youu have been given these to use in
the quest for the remaining two blades. However, word has spread to
the peoples of the neighboring areas, and two groups are working
against you to prevent your securing these swords. Beware the Hold
of the Stonefist and the Rovers of the Barren! Only so much time
remains for you to locate the last two Blades of Corusk...and your
enemies are on the horizon.<BR><BR>Find the blades, and reclaim your
birthright of honor and respect; fail, and be outcast from your tribes
for life. The choice is yours.
