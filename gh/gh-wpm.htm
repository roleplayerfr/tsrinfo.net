<center><i>Immortality at any price breeds a menace beyond measure!</i></center><BR>
In ancient times, a sorceror named Keraptis searched for eternal life.
Within the magma domes and steam vents of an active volcano, he
concluded his arcane experiments. Eventually he faded into legend, and
the world heard no more of Keraptis for more than a millennium.<BR><BR>
Two decades ago, however, Keraptis reappeared in White Plume. The
mountain and its insane lord proved too much for most, but eventually
courage and justice triumphed. Keraptis was finally dead...or so the
world thought.<BR><BR>Now, twenty years later, a face has appeared in
the volcano's smoke - the face of Keraptis himself, say those who
should know. Is the vile wizard immortal after all? Or is there an
even greater threat building beneath White Plume Mountain?<BR><BR>The
original <a href="../dd1/s2.htm"><i>S2: White Plume Mountain</i></a>
by Lawrence Schick, released in 1979, was one of the first scripted
scenarios to appear for the AD&D game. If you have your own fond
memories of experiences within the volcano, you will find this
adventure just as fascinating, and just as deadly, as its predecessor.
If you are about to tackle White Plume Mountain for the first time, it
will be an experience you'll never forget.<BR><BR><center><i>For four
to ten characters of 7th to 10th level.</i></center>
