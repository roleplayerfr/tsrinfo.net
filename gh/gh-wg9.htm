Ever seen a gargoyle without its wings? It's a pretty funny sight.
But don't laugh out loud in fron of them - <i>they</i> don't think it's
all that hilarious...<BR><BR><i>Gargoyle</i> is an adventure set in the
world of GREYHAWK, the longest-running of TSR's game worlds for the
ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. A pair of gargoyles wake up one
morning to find their wings missing, and contact the players to help
them recover them. A great many AD&D players have been asking for
low-level adventures suitable for beginners, and <i>Gargoyle</i> is the
first of several planned for this year. Designed for levels 1 to 4,
this adventure can be enjoyed by novices and experienced players alike.
